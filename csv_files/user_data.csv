SREEKANTOM SAI SAKETH <2503848@sit.singaporetech.edu.sg>,INF1002 - PythonProject-Lab-P1,"Hi everyone,
Looks like we’re teamed up for the INF1002 group project! Since the first part is due next Monday at 8am, I thought it’d be good for us to connect quickly so we’re all on the same page.
To be honest, I’m not fully clear on the objectives and goals yet—it’s a bit hard to understand from the prof right now—but I’ll go through the project PDF soon so we can figure it out together.
To make communication easier, here’s my Telegram handle: @ssaketh. Just drop me a message, and I’ll set up a group chat so we can get started together.
Looking forward to working with you all!
Best,
Saketh "

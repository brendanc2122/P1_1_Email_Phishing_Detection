ASK THE FOOL Q. I'M TIRED OF GETTING SO MANY CREDIT CARD OFFERS IN THE MAIL. I ALREADY HAVE A CARD AND I DON'T WANT ANY MORE MAIL OFFERING ME NEW ONES. HOW CAN I STOP IT? A. There are three main credit bureaus in the United States, and they've agreed that if someone contacts one of them and asks to be removed from junk mail (er, ""direct mail"") lists and telemarketing phone lists, they'll all honor the request. Full Answer:

YOUR MONEY RESOLUTIONS YOU CAN KEEP
Let's face it, New Year's resolutions are mostly nightmares that hang over our heads like that dark cloud that follows Eeyore everywhere he goes. We mostly fail to keep our resolutions because they are too vague and imply guilt-inducing judgment. 1. Live every moment. 2. Be a good person. 3. Lose a lot of weight. No pressure. Right? Wrong. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=562070 Don't despair. We've put together a quick, proactive to-do list that is actually doable. This year's resolution: Save big bucks now and live comfortably in the future. Now that's a resolution you can get behind. Let's get started! 1. DIAL AWAY YOUR DEBT It's true. You can lower your credit card interest rates with one phone call.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562071 2. GET MORE FROM YOUR SAVINGS
Don't stash your short-term cash savings under your mattress. Earn higher yields on CDs, money markets, and more. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562072 3. INVEST FOR LESS Make sure your broker isn't charging you too much. Compare rates and hire a new one in only 60 seconds. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562073 4. RETIRE EARLY
Thanks to recent tax law changes, you can start pitching in more to your retirement accounts.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562074 5. REFINANCE AND SAVE When interest rates drop, some homeowners have the opportunity to save big money.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562075 If this list seems too daunting, and you don't want to go it alone, you can get some unbiased, professional advice about your finances with TMF Money Advisor. In fact, we're so excited about this service, we are offering a free one-month trial subscription.

SPOTLIGHT SHOULD ALL MY SAVINGS BE IN THE MARKET?
Um, no. We are big supporters of the idea that all of your long-term money should be in the stock market. But over the short term, the market is too volatile. Buying stocks for short-term gain is really speculating, not investing. Would you have wanted to have your emergency fund, or your house down payment, or your kid's tuition in the Nasdaq at its height on March 10, 2000? If you can't afford or wait out a 30% drop in the value of your savings, keep it out of the market. Of course, we're not just going to leave you hanging. To figure out the best place to keep your short-term savings, visit our nifty Savings Center. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562078 -----------------------------------------------------------------
COMMUNITY TIPS DO (AT LEAST) ONE THING DIFFERENTLY
Folks on the Living Below Your Means discussion board have been sharing at least one thing they are going to do differently in 2002 to save money. -I am going to make sure I carry my coupon envelope in my purse so I don't find myself at the grocery store buying a bunch of stuff on which I could save a bunch of money if I hadn't left my coupons at home. -Make sure I get reimbursed for every dime my company owes me. I have a bad habit of not filing expense reports for little stuff, like 10 miles of mileage to go to a mediation. Ten miles is $3.10 and if I do that 10 times a year, that's more than 30 bucks, and definitely worth filing an expense report for. -I'm going to make at least one crock-pot meal a week so I don't get tempted to go out and buy something to eat. Fridays would be a great time to do this. -Either cut down on the long-distance phone calls, or else find a cheaper long-distance plan. -Document everything that I give to charity, including the clothes and books, so that I can deduct it from my taxes. -Keep turning down the thermostat at night and when I leave the house. Run my humidifier (moist air is cheaper to heat). Have any tips of your own? Add to the growing list here.

Hash: SHA1 CAUCE NEWS Volume 6, Number 2 June, 2002 In this issue: * Progress of Senate anti-spam bill
* European Union bans spam IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHY YOU GOT THIS MESSAGE: Please see the
""About This Message"" section at the end. - -------------------------------------------------------------- * Progress of Senate anti-spam bill Over a year ago, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) introduced S.630, the CAN
SPAM Act of 2001. This bill would require UCE to have a valid return
address to facilitate consumers' removal from spam lists. It would
place enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, and
state Attorneys General. It would also permit Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) to enforce violations, up to $10 per illegal spam.
It would preempt any stricter state anti-spam laws. The Senate Commerce Committee considered the bill on May 17th, and
reported it out largely unchanged. It's not now scheduled for further
action in the Senate. CAUCE has always opposed this bill, since we believe it would lead to
more spam, not less. When South Korea passed a similar opt-out law
last year, spam from Korea soon increased by a factor of 10. Our April 2001 press release goes into more detail about the problems
with S.630: http://www.cauce.org/pressreleases/pr-s630.shtml We're pleased that the Congress is looking at spam issues again, and
hope that in the future we can help them create an effective bill that
the entire Internet community can support. - -------------------------------------------------------------- * European Union bans spam GLOBAL INTERNET COMMUNITY APPLAUDS EUROPEAN ANTI-SPAM VOTE May 31, 2002 - The Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail
(CAUCE), EuroCAUCE, CAUCE India, CAUCE Canada and the Coalition Against
Unsolicited Bulk E-Mail, Australia (CAUBE.au) today applauded the decision
by the European Parliament to protect European Internet users from the
practice of unsolicited e-mail advertisements. Yesterday's vote will turn
Europe into a virtual ""spam-free zone"" after the formal adoption of the
directive, making it illegal to send unsolicited e-mail, text message or
other similar advertisements to individuals with whom companies do not
have a preexisting business relationship. ""This is a tremendous day for European Internet users,"" said EuroCAUCE
Chairman George Mills. ""We are extremely pleased that the European
Parliament has listened to the citizens of its member countries and added
the right to be left alone by spammers to its efforts to protect the
privacy of Europeans."" While six European Union member countries had already formalized ""opt-in""
in their national laws and regulations, yesterday's vote should turn all
of Europe into a spam-free zone by the end of 2003. ""Unfortunately, the rest of the world's Internet-using countries,
including the United States, now lag behind Europe in their protection
of Internet users,"" said CAUCE Chairman Scott Hazen Mueller. ""This is
a tremendous first step, but the rest of the world now needs to follow
Europe's lead and unite behind protection of Internet users and
network owners from abusive and costly unsolicited e-mail
advertising."" ""This decision is the direct result of Internet users throughout the
European Union standing up for their rights, and Members of the
European Parliament listening to their constituents,"" said Mills. ""Our
members and our volunteers performed an integral part of this process,
translating, lobbying and educating their representatives."" More information on the E.U. directive is available on the European
Parliament's Web site ,

"""The ISO17799 Newsletter"" <iso17799@securityrisk.co.uk>",The ISO17799 Newsletter - Issue 4,"______________________________________________________ THE ISO17799 NEWSLETTER - EDITION 4
______________________________________________________ Welcome to the fourth edition of the ISO17799 newsletter, designed to
keep you abreast of news and developments with respect to ISO17799 and
information security. The information contained in this newsletter is absolutely free to our
subscribers and provides guidance on various practical issues, plus
commentary on recent Information Security incidents. Guidance and information included in this issue: 1) The ISO17799 Toolkit Uncovered 2) Social Engineering - Are you Susceptible?
3) ISO17799: A World Wide Phenomena
4) Stranger Danger
5) ISO17700: More Frequently Asked Questions
6) Credit Card Transactions - Minimize the Risks
7) BSI Certifications - Congratulations
8) ISO17799 Section 11 - BCP Review
9) It Couldn't Happen Here.... Could It?
10) Subscription Information THE ISO17799 TOOLKIT UNCOVERED
=============== The ISO17799 standard can be acquired either stand alone or as part of
an introductory pack appropriately called 'The ISO17799 Toolkit'. But
why was it packaged thus, and what is included in the pack? The purpose of the toolkit is to help organizations get off to a flying
start with respect to ISO17799... not only to understand the standard
itself but to begin to address many of the standard's requirements more
quickly. The contents can be broken down into two groups: those that help the
organization to understand where ISO17799 fits and what is involved in
embracing it, and those that help an organization to take the first
critical steps to compliance. In the former group are the 'RoadMap to Certification' (which broadly
describes the process of gaining certification), the 'XL Management
Presentation' (which explains the history, background and current status
of the standard) and of course the ISO17799 standard itself (both
parts). In the latter group are some key items to aid compliance. These include
a comprehensive set of ISO17799 compliant security policies to address
section 3 (Security Policy) and business continuity audit checklists to
help address section 11 (Business Continuity Management). It doesn't end there, however. For the audit section there is a detailed
set of audit questionnaires to address various issues and platforms. For
newcomers to information security there is even a substantial glossary
of terms. Clearly, creating such a toolkit was a significant undertaking. However,
in terms of helping organizations exploring the initial stages of
ISO17799, it can be invaluable. More information on the ISO17799 Toolkit and how to purchase can be
found at: http://www.iso17799-made-easy.com The standard itself can alternatively be procured from: http://www.iso17799.net SOCIAL ENGINEERING - ARE YOU SUSCEPTIBLE?
====================
The term 'social engineering' can conjure up a variety of ideas, usually
based around the concept of genetic tampering. However, when applied to
IT security, it has its own implications and its own vocabulary. Following interviews with known computer criminals, a list of approaches
has been produced. These are designed to gather information without the
target even realizing that they have parted with it. The attempts are often made on an opportune bases, with common locations
for this sort of activity being planes, trains and pubs. The telephone
is probably the major source of pre-meditated acts. The following are some of the major techniques employed: BAITING
This essentially involves asking a variety of questions, including some
leading questions designed to 'catch' the right answers. Often, items of
conversation are introduced based upon replies received. The fiction is
legitimized with small amounts of fact in the right places. PULLING RANK
This amounts ot the perpetrator assuming a more senior position in the
company than the victim and is usually enacted on the telephone. It does
not necessitate direct impersonation... only the POSITION needs to be
assumed. EXHAUSTING
This involves asking a constant stream of similar questions to wear down
the target. SURF BOARDING
Basically this is looking over someone's shoulder at something
confidential. This could be directly, through a window, through a
doorway, etc. SURVEYS
The information given freely in surveys can often be extremely useful to
a criminal. The surveys can initially be for entirely legitimate
purposes, or can be completely bogus from the start. In either case
sensitive information can often be obtained and unwittingly disclosed. There are of course many other techniques. However, disclosure can be
prevented via the use of a series of common sense rules and policies. Before releasing any information it is essential to at least establish: a) the sensitivity of the information
b) your authority to exchange or release the information
c) the real identity of the third party (proper authentication)
d) the purpose of the exchange The act of exchange should also be recorded for audit purposes. ISO17799 - A WORLD WIDE PHENOMINA ================
Disney would have said ""it's a small world after all"", but the global
take on of ISO17799 proves that organizations the planet over are
embracing it with enthusiasm. To illustrate the global nature of the standard, we recently created a
table from the last 500 purchases of the standard from the ISO17799
Electronic Shop (www.iso17799.net). The figures below do come with a
serious health warning though - the Electronic Shop is a credit card
purchase system. Some cultures are not as comfortable or familiar as
others with credit card purchase and will therefore have their purchase
position significantly understated. An example is India, which acquires
substantial numbers of the standard, only two of which show in the last
500 from the download location. That aside, the table makes interesting reading: Argentina 1 Australia 6 Austria 5 Barbados 2 Belgium 5 Bermuda 1 Bosnia and Herzegovina 1 Brasil 2 Brazil 4 Canada 52 Cayman Islands 1 Chile 3 China 3 Colombia 5 Costa Rica 1 Croatia 1
Cyprus 1 Denmark 5 Deutschland 5 Egypt 4 England 26 France 3 Germany 20 Greece 3 Guatemala 1 Hong Kong 7 Hungary 1 India 2 Indonesia 2 Ireland 11 Isle of Man 1 Israel 1 Italia 1 Italy 20 Japan 3 Malaysia 5 Mexico 9

=======
As you read this article, look around at your working environment. The
items/information you have to hand may not seem very sensitive because
you deal with them every day... but now look again. If you were alone and not a member of staff, how would you view them?
What would you find if you looked around? Picture yourself as a visitor
passing through. What can you hear in terms of conversation? What can
you see? The chances are that you can hear and see quite a lot that you would not
want to be openly disclosed to the outside world. If this is the case,
the security of your information is at risk potentially from every
visitor, stranger, subcontractor, etc. This article is not written with the intention of discrediting visitors,
but nonetheless, it is important to be fully AWARE of what CAN happen if
due caution is not exercised. The following guidelines may help in ensuring that the risks are
minimized: * Your reception/visitor area should issue distinctive badges and ensure
that visitors wear them * Consider using different colored badges for each day of the week. * Challenge those who are not displaying any identity badges * If your location issues identity badges - make sure YOU wear yours * Do not be afraid to ask someone who they are visiting and what they
are doing * Do not be lazy... escort visitors from reception (if applicable)...
don't let them make their way to you * Do not hold doors open for people not displaying their ID * Do not leave visitors alone ISO17799 - MORE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
===================== 1) How many controls are there in the standard?
Part 1 is organized into 10 sections. There are 127 main controls and
over 500 detailed controls in total. 2) What is part 2?
Part 2 basically explains how to apply the standard itself, and how to
build and operate an information security management system. 3) How old is it?
The standard stems from an original publication in 1993, from the DTI in
the UK. It became BS7799 in 1995 and of course ISO17799 in 2000. 4) What is accreditation?
An accreditation body can authorize others to ""certify"" third parties
under the standard (p2). A number of accreditation bodies exist in
different countries. 5) Is certification for life?
No. It is normally for three year periods. 6) ISO17799 is used throughout the world, but was it internationally
created? Yes indeed. The latest versions included input from
representatives from many nations, including Australia, Brazil, Germany,
Norway, UK and USA, amongst others. 7) Is it linked to a specific national legal system?
No. It is generic in terms of legislation. CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS: MINIMIZE THE RISKS
====================== The use of credit and debit cards to purchase goods and services has
become an everyday convenience that we take for granted, but there are
associated information security risks which we should pause to consider,
especially when making payments over the Internet. Web sites are becoming an increasingly popular means of purchasing goods
and services, but they have also become popular targets for cyber
criminals, who often use stolen credit card numbers to purchase goods,
which can then be easily exchanged for cash. There are also relatively
simple technologies now readily available which could be used by hackers
to surreptitiously steal vast amounts of money, a few pounds at a time,
from millions of people. A survey by the IT research company Gartner
(http://www.gartner.com) predicted that Internet crime involving the
""mass victimization"" of consumers could take place by the end of this
year. We recommend the following best practice guidelines to minimize the
risks involved in credit card transactions: * Ensure that credit cards used to purchase goods or services on the
Internet have a low credit limit, or if debit cards are used, that they
have limited funds and are only topped up to cover specific Internet
purchases. * All expenses incurred through Internet transactions should be
carefully audited on a regular basis for any anomalies. * Only enter credit card details on a Web site if you are confident as
to its authenticity and that the connection is secure - the prefix https
(as opposed to the usual http) in the Web Site address indicates a
secure connection. * If the security of a Web site is in doubt, any confidential
information posted to it may be exposed to malicious intent. Be
extremely cautious when posting confidential details on any site where
the Internet Service Provider hosting the site is not verified. Note
that we have pre-checked all sites referenced in this newsletter for
security! * If ordering by telephone using a credit card, ensure that you are
talking to the correct person. If you are unsure whether the
organization you are dealing with will handle your details sensitively,
pay by some other means. * Lost or stolen credit card details may be used for Internet
transactions. Inform the card issuer and relevant person within your
organization immediately if a company credit card is lost or stolen. BSI - CERTIFICATIONS

Business continuity planning is covered by section 11 of the standard, a
core requirement of which is the creation and maintenance of a business
continuity plan. Creating such a plan from scratch is a difficult undertaking of course.
This is one reason why software products were produced. Unfortunately
these often become problematic in themselves... difficult to learn,
expensive, etc. Recent times have therefore seen a move to simplification, with
organizations keen to avoid adding complexity to an already complex
task. At the vanguard of this change was a product developed entirely in
MS-Word: The BCP Generator. This was designed from top down to simplify business continuity
planning. It comprises two components: a plan template and an
interactive guide (the latter using Word macros to jump to and fro into
the correct part of the template). It's impact upon the business
continuity scene has been substantial, with organizations from the very
largest to the smallest embracing the tool and its concepts. It is in
active use in over 40 countries. With this change of emphasis in the business continuity planning market,
there is now NO excuse for not creating a full recovery plan. The old
lines of ""too expensive"" and ""too difficult"" are now less hollow than
they ever were. Although section 11 is very clear with respect to the
need of a comprehensive plan, it is surely also a matter of due
diligence to have one, and equally, irresponsibility not to have one. For information on the BCP Generator see: http://www.disaster-recovery-plan.com For information on business continuity generally, see:
http://www.yourwindow.to/business-continuity/ IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE....COULD IT?
================== Every issue of The ISO17799 Newsletter features at least one TRUE story
of an information security breach and its consequences. Again, in this
issue, we focus upon 'low tech' but high impact incidents: 1) On 25th October a contract programmer who had once worked for a large
US based bank walked into the 'inner sanctum' of the main building (the
security guards remembered him as someone permitted to do so). In the
dealing room he claimed to be conducting a quality audit and
interrogated a junior employee and watched a program run - noting down
security codes as they were entered. He then left and hung around
outside until just after normal trading time. He then rang the Bank from a public phone box and initiated an
electronic funds transfer using the codes... $10.2m to a Swiss account. The plan nearly failed when he found that he had noted one of the codes
incorrectly, but he rang the Bank department back and incredibly managed
to trick a different employee into revealing the correct digit. He flew to Switzerland and later returned with the money. He was caught
simply because he couldn't resist boasting about his great feat. When
the police contacted the bank they were still totally unaware of their
loss! 2) Remote, or dial-in access can be a real Achilles heel if not properly
controlled. In a recent case a young hacker gained access to a major
company's system by using the default password of a system engineer
(which had never been changed!). This gave him considerable scope and powers of access. To cover for
himself, however, he semi-disabled the machine log, changed a number of
user passwords, created several fictitious privileged users and tampered
with the dial back system. Getting more ambitious he established a communication link with another
computer and ended up making it crash. All this took place over a couple
of evenings. To recover from the havoc the installation had to close down its prime
computer and restore from the previous weeks back-up, at considerable
cost. 3) Over a period of nine months, the number of computer malfunctions
within a large company had risen from an average of two per year to
critical levels. The impact was such that the business fell behind with
its invoicing systems and had to buy processing and backup from third
parties. As it could not deliver some of its services reliably, it
started to lose the confidence of its customers. The situation began to
spiral. Eventually, the company suspected foul play may be involved and called
the police. Secret surveillance equipment was installed to monitor
staff. One was filmed lightly scratching circuit boards in disk units
and also attaching paper clips to them. Both these actions led to a
short circuit. When confronted, he confessed everything. His motive was to earn
overtime, which was required to process the overlap work which was
delayed by the malfunction. He netted 689 UKP over the 9 months. The
company lost at least 500,000 UKP. CONTRIBUTIONS ======Have you got something to say on the topic of ISO17799... a fresh

"""Michael Robertson"" <michaelr@lindows.com>",Lindows.com: Michael's Minute: Lindows.com Report Card,"If this message is not displaying properly, click here to launch it in your browser. Michael's Minute: Lindows.com Report Card As summer arrives, many school children are coming home with their
report cards. I thought this would be a good time to see what kind of
grades Lindows.com received for their first 9 months in operation.. To view the Timeline of Lindows.com's first 9 months in business, click
here . Operating System: As of last week, consumers can experience LindowsOS in one of two ways.
One way is to buy a computer running LindowsOS from Walmart.com , for as little as $299. This is a
significant milestone for us, as we've partnered with our first builder
(Microtel) and retailer (Walmart). These computers work great out of the
box and are ideal for general purpose computing tasks. For those who already have a computer and also wish to try LindowsOS, we
offer the Insider program . This gives
people wanting early access to LindowsOS a chance to try out LindowsOS
as it develops. Currently, Insiders report installation success about
80% of the time on their PCs. Therefore we have some room to grow,
consequently, this product is not yet for everyone. Some may wonder how we can sell a computer at Walmart when the program available directly
from Lindows.com is billed as not completely ready. The difference is
the Walmart computers are certified,
ensuring that all components work elegantly with LindowsOS. That's much
different than offering a software program that will work on any
computer in the world - that's very difficult. It's the difference
between making a single pair of shoes for a known foot size versus
opening a shoe store with every style of shoe for every size foot. The
first one is easy, the second one is a much bigger job. While the installer is fantastically easy and fast (the entire OS
installs in under 5 minutes), we've got a lot more work to do to support
a wider range of hardware, printers and other devices. Grade: B _____ Software: Our goal to give people choice means giving them choice not just on
their operating system, but access to all the programs they'll want to
add to their computer to really make it work for them in their school,
home or business. Click-N-Run is the easiest way to
load software onto a computer. For the first time a Linux based system
has leapt ahead of Microsoft's operating systems in ease of use. With
1,000 plus programs already in the Click-N-Run Warehouse , users can find quality software
titles for just about any computing task and, with a single mouse-click
download, install and run these programs. All these titles are included
in the $99. This is a fantastic consumer experience and price point.
Look for a lot more great software in the Warehouse in the future.
Grade: A- _____ Microsoft Windows Compatibility: We live in a Microsoft world, so there needs to be a bridge from the
legacy world to the broadband LindowsOS world. This means we need to
support some bridge programs, file types and network devices to help
people interact with the legacy Microsoft world. LindowsOS computers
come with software to view, print and copy popular Microsoft
applications like: MS Word files, MS PowerPoint files and MS Excel
documents. There's great Linux based alternatives and we'll guide people
to those alternatives (they're better than most people realize). To edit
Microsoft files, we'd highly recommend one of the office suites in our
Warehouse such as OpenOffice . Many of these programs are of very high-quality and a great value since
they're included in the Warehouse .
Sometimes there are no viable alternatives for those programs, so we're
investing necessary resources to support some Microsoft Windows based
programs. Stay tuned for more developments in this area. Our printer
support is ok, but there's lots of room for more drivers. Connecting to
MS Windows based file servers is still a challenge. We need to get
better in the above areas. Grade: B _____ Communication: We've tried to be diligent in communicating where our company is going
which is why there's typically a weekly Michael's Minute . While our overall goal has not deviated -
Bringing Choice To Your Computer - our implementation has become more
focused as we listened to what our Insiders and potential customers have
told us. (Keep sending me your comments.) We have been de-emphasizing
running Microsoft Windows programs because many of you told us you
detest spending hundreds of dollars on individual software programs,
forced upgrades and activation codes. It's not just the operating
system, but costly Microsoft programs you're wanting to avoid. Consequently, we've been emphasizing Click-N-Run because it will change
the way you think about software. Having a neatly categorized library of 1,000+ software titles all for a
flat annual fee at your digital fingertips is an entirely new way to
think about paying for software. It's immediate, elegant and affordable. There are lots of mischaracterizations about Lindows.com swirling around
- which happens when you have a small organization which can't address
every question or publication. We'll do a better job of addressing these
in the future. For now, I wrote up answers to the Top Myths about
Lindows.com. Check them out by visiting: www.lindows.com/myths Grade:
B+ _____ Overall: B+ Michael Robertson Please visit support.lindows.com to
answer questions you may have about LindowsOS or Lindows.com. Bringing Choice to Your Computer! LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being
offered from Lindows.com Builder
partners. The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download
and preview to Lindows.com Insider
partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to
install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware. The
General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware
and includes unique features such as a ""Friendly-Install"" alongside an
existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation
process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a
select set of ""bridge"" Windows-compatible programs. For more information

"""Michael Robertson"" <michaelr@lindows.com>",Lindows.com: Michael's Minute: Do the Math...Dispel the Myths,"If this message is not displaying properly, click here to launch it in your browser. Michael's Minute: Do the Math...Dispel the Myths A reporter came by the Lindows.com offices
last Friday. He told me that he wanted to try and use LindowsOS to
write a story, but he didn't think it was possible because his office
used Microsoft Word .doc files. I asked him to have a seat and watch. I turned on the Walmart.com computer
and then clicked on the running man which took me to the Click-N-Run Warehouse where I installed OpenOffice using Click-N-Run. I then clicked
the ""Run It"" button which opened the word processor OpenOffice Writer.
I then typed ""Linux is ready for the desktop and consumers can save
hundreds using LindowsOS."" I selected ""Save as Microsoft Word."" The reporter was not only surprised, he was amazed. Like many reporters,
he was under the impression that Linux was only for servers. The simple
word processor demonstration went a long way to show him otherwise. For
Linux to become a driving force in desktop computing it will have to
overcome a couple of myths. The first myth is that Linux is too hard to install and configure. That
may have been true in the past, but we've annihilated this myth with the
latest version of LindowsOS --which installs on most machines in under 5
minutes. It's point- and-shoot easy - easier than any other operating
system (Microsoft products included). See for yourself at . The other myth is that Linux is just for the server and none of the
graphical programs --which desktop users have come to rely on-- exist.
Not only have many of the Linux software programs made quantum leaps
over the last couple of years, but they've gotten quite good at reading
and writing Microsoft formats. The easiest way to experience these
products is via the Click-N-Run Warehouse. Here's a quick list of some of the quality programs available today in
the Warehouse all downloaded and
installed with a single click: OpenOffice - This one installation will equip a computer with an
impressive collection of productivity programs each of which will open
the corresponding Microsoft file format and allow you to edit files and
swap them with Microsoft counterparts. Programs included are: OpenOffice Writer - Word processor (reads Microsoft Word docs) OpenOffice Calc - Spreadsheet (reads Microsoft Excel) OpenOffice Impress- Presentation package (reads Microsoft PowerPoint)
OpenOffice Draw - A vector based drawing program Click here for a great
tutorial on getting to know OpenOffice. GIMP If you are familiar with Adobe's Photoshop,
you'll want to Click-N-Run GIMP. It's a powerful image editor. Evolution For those used to Microsoft's

Pick of the Week DECK Version: 3.5 File size: 6.6MB License: Free to try; $399.00 to buy Minimum Requirements: Mac OS 9.x or Mac OS X Looking for a professional, multitrack audio workstation under OS X? This entry from BIAS, while maybe not the most attractive Mac app on the block, gives you some hefty editing functionality--whether you're working in broadcast, film, video, or any other multimedia environment. The big brother to BIAS' cheaper Deck LE, Deck 3.5 lets you process soundtracks, edit dialogue, spot effects, and record ADR-style voice-overs. Deck also supports surround mixing and up to four real-time effects plug-ins per track for music production. A good value, and one of the first of its kind to hit OS X, this midrange app deserves a listen.

The Week in Wares IN INTERNET: CAPTAIN FTP Version: 1.3 File size: 793K License: Free Minimum requirements: Mac OS X Designed completely from scratch to work with OS X, Captain FTP is a new client that makes finding, uploading, and downloading files online easier than ever. Since it makes full use of OS X's multithreaded multitasking capabilities, you can set up as many simultaneous connections as you like without slowing down other work on your Mac too much. The program supports drag-and-drop operation and resuming interrupted downloads. It also sports a built-in address book, and integrated BBEdit links. The interface deserves awards for clarity and good looks. Grab files in style: http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=49-ZM4cIEpSenMA07qVX4RVXFO5JSFR Want to review Captain FTP?

AquilaCalendar is refreshingly different: you can design your own calendar windows, choosing from a plethora of basic options (day, week, month, year, several months together, and so on), customize your calendar with colors and fonts, and more. To-do lists and notes-to-self can be added to calendars or you can add a handy clock and holiday markers, among other options. The interface fits with the OS X design theme, and makes getting organized no more difficult than it has to be.

This handy little editor offers all the basics like unlimited Undo and Redo commands, translucent drag-and-drop capabilities, several text styles, and the option to highlight selected text. Also, you'll be able to use it to act as a text editor for an FTP client such as Fetch, Interarchy, NetFinder, or Transmit.

Even if you don't, you should take this remake of the old classic for a spin. Maneuver your way through a maze of corridors while setting off bombs to clear a path for your escape. You'll also need to pick up coins for extra points and stay clear of those nasty aliens to stay alive. Blast your way through eight alien-infested areas, each one divided into 10 subzones, and kick the Big Alien Boss back to where he came from.

today! I don't usually spend much time explaining metaphors. They are, after all, metaphorical. They can be filled with whatever symbolism you choose. Written well, we all come to some similar understanding of their meaning. But, I'll depart today, contrary to my normal practice, to take a few minutes explaining a recent metaphor. I'm a Linux guy through and through. As a user, I see myself as right about at the average on the curve. For love of the language and open source attitude, though, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone with quite the same level of enthusiasm. Put simply, there's very little about the Linux and broader open source worlds that I don't like or believe in. Take, for example, the practice of recursive acronyms. GNU (""Gnu's Not Unix""), HURD (""Herd of Unix-Replacing Daemons""), WINE (""Wine Is Not an Emulator""), even PHP (""PHP Hypertext Processor"") - all carry on the tradition of recursion in the Unix/Linux world. Goofy as it sounds, I love this stuff. So it is that I set out to create a recursive metaphor last week. It could only have happened on or about the 4th of July. In fact, it happened in the edition of the 3rd. I wrote a piece about how we Americans spend more time over the course of a year talking about what's wrong with our system than what's right. I wrote it knowing full well that many of the responses I'd get would be a) from readers outside the US and b) in sharp disagreement to my comments or those of citizens of other countries. You're following me, right? People would disagree with an article that said we spend much time disagreeing. This, of course, would prove my point in a somewhat metaphorical way - the perfect recursive metaphor. The point was to be made yet more perfectly by the eventual inclusion in Penguin Shell of the comments of someone from outside the US disagreeing with my take our argumentativeness as Americans. Ideally, they would be comments that disagreed with our collective American perception of being disagreeable. They would, of course, point out things about which citizens of other countries can disagree with Americans on. By exercising the right to disagree, we'd subtly agree that we have that right. Yet another level of recursion and a final layer of metaphor. The response to both my own and Johan Sauviller's comments was overwhelming. In the main, I believe both were appreciated. Many commented on the balance of the two pieces. Some readers were surprised, I think, to see a dissenting opinion published so quickly, if at all. Overall, the ability to express honestly held opinions, to agree and to disagree on a global level closed the circle on the metaphor in a perfect way. Things have, however, gotten a bit more ugly in the past few days. I'm not sure whether some were slow in getting to the July 3rd issue, or whether it's just been stewing since then. Take, for instance, these comments by a reader who will remain mercifully nameless: We get enough
America bashing from our left-wing whacko extremist press and schools here
in the USA that we don't wish to hear some (insert favorite adjective here)
from Belgium whining too! Followed by: ... please don't let Tony single-handedly tarnish the fine reputation
of Lockergnome. I'm sure there are other articulate Linux experts out there who would be able to replace him. ... and, in a later note on the topic ... Censorship is to be encouraged in a
free-market society whenever and wherever it doesn't come from the
government. Clearly, the metaphor just whizzed right over the heads of some. http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/daily.html"" target=""_blankChris has been great about allowing all his authors plenty of room in the editorial piece at the beginning of each newsletter. This particular piece is no exception. He's shown a quiet confidence in the face of some very shrill comments. While we all generally stay focused on technical issues, Chris has shown unwavering support for the notion that we geeks are, in the end, humans with opinions and thoughts to share. I think it's one of the things that makes the Lockergnome newsletters stand out from the pack - the personal touch. So, despite the irrationality of some of this week's comments, I'll continue to occasionally throw in a personal aside with the technical stuff. Just watch out. Recursive metaphors are only funny until someone puts an eye out. Lockergnome readers, SAVE 50% on the Computing Encyclopedia!

SPECIAL OFFER for Lockergnome readers, Win Apps in Linux? Yesterday, I mentioned an interesting review of two products for Linux by A bit of background is in order. CodeWeavers is, in their own words, "" ... the leading corporate backer of the http://wine.codeweavers.com/"" target=""_blankWine Project. Wine has been, for the past several years, an ongoing project to port Windows applications to Linux. It's a tough goal, but it's also one that's been undertaken by http://www.lindows.com/"" target=""_blankothers in the past year or so. Though the progress has been slow, the Wine project has managed to stay at the front of this development realm. http://codeweavers.com/products/crossover/"" target=""_blankCrossOver Plugin marks a change in the philosophy of the Wine Project. Prior to its release, Wine had taken a ""full system"" approach. Running Windows applications in Wine required the installation of a sizeable daemon and no small amount of configuration work. CrossOver Plugin has moved Wine away from the system-wide approach to one that's much more modular. Rather than executing at system startup, Wine is called as-needed, with the virtual Windows path to the called program. When the program is closed, so is Wine. CrossOver Plugin has focused on creating Linux functionality with one related set of Windows applications: browser plugins. The results stand as a clear indication that the change in philosophy is a success. Off the top, CrossOver Plugin bundles QuickTime 5, Windows Media Player 6.2, Shockwave 8.5, Flash 6, and RealPlayer 8 into a Linux-accesible browser plugin package. Throw in more esoteric apps like IPix, Trillian, Authorware Web Player 6 and eFax Messenger 2, and you've got virtually every need plugin need covered. But this package doesn't stop there. Included in the CrossOver Plugin package are viewers for Word, Excel and Powerpoint, as well as several Microsoft-oriented fonts. Honestly, I was stunned at the range of applications offered by the CodeWeavers developers. Having had some experience with Wine, I was a bit leery about the install process and about the ability to get all these great applications to work with my RedHat setup. I've never been completely successful with Wine, but I hoped for the best when I started the CrossOver Plugin installation. I really did want these apps to work. The installation was quite easy. By running the install-crossover.sh script from the command line, I was able to install the installers for both CrossOver Plugin and CrossOver Office, which we'll talk about tomorrow. I started the plugin installs with QuickTime, a tool I've admittedly missed in Linux. In the background, CrossOver Plugin had already created a virtual C:\ drive on my machine. I clicked on the QuickTime install and immediately saw a familiar sight - the Vise installer in its Windows format. CrossOver Plugin first checked for feedback from the Windows binary, opened a virtual Windows window, then stepped out while the Vise installer took care of the rest. Though the install failed four times, it appeared to be a server failure rather than a failure of the CrossOver program. I kept ""retry""ing and, with some persistence, managed to get a full QuickTime 5 install downloaded from the Apple servers. Quite literally, the install looked and performed exactly as I've seem many times in Windows. When the install was completed, CrossOver again checked for the Windows binary, located the appropriate .dll files in the virtual C:\ drive and dropped the plugins into the /home/tony/.netscape/plugins and /home/tony/.mozilla/plugins directories. The process was so smooth that I had to check the plugin listings in these browsers - ""Help"", ""About Plugins."" Sure enough, the CrossOver QuickTime plugin was listed. Quickly, I ran out to the Apple site and opened the ""Men In Black II"" movie trailer. QuickTime performed flawlessly. I followed with the Windows Media Player, Shockwave, Flash, IPix, and eFax Messenger installs. Of those, the only ones that weren't self-contained in the CrossOver install were IPix and eFax. Even at that, the installer pointed me to the Windows download then found the .exe file when the download was done. Within a half-hour, I had all installed and tested. Then, just for grins, I installed RealPlayer 8 via CrossOver. This was despite the recommendation in the installer screen to use the Linux version. It went as smoothly as the others with one caveat - the player played media files at a much faster speed than that in Windows. Fast enough to make me laugh, in fact, reminded of Dave and Alvin the Chipmunk. Ah well, six out of seven is pretty strong given my previous troubles with Wine. I also installed a few fonts - Arial, Times New Roman, Trebuchet, and Veranda. In every case, the install was quick and absolutely painless. Wine has always held great promise. At times, it's been painful to watch the tedious pace of development, only because that promise was so alluring. With the backing of CodeWeavers and a fundamental change in the approach to development, Wine has finally realized the goal of integrating Windows applications seamlessly into the stable Linux environment. The results are so strong that, if I didn't know better, I'd swear that a few of these plugins actually run better in Linux than in their native Windows. Honestly, I didn't realize how much I missed them until I started using them in Linux today. Tomorrow holds a few surpirses, with a look at CodeWeavers' CrossOver Office package. Kernel Configuration - Part IX We're nine parts into the kernel configuration series, with quite a bit yet to go. If you haven't been following along, we're breaking out the configuration screens one at a time in an attempt to shed some light on the purpose and function of each. With that knowledge, you should be able to make a clear decision as to how to configure each section. Today, it's the Parallel Port support section. This is pretty simple. If you need parallel port support - such as for a printer - select this option either as a driver built into the kernel or as a loadable module. Most will use the PC-style hardware option in conjuction with a Windows printer. But that's not all the parallel port can be used for. As an example, the builds I did with the telescope company required parallel port support, as the telescope cameras were attached to this port. Be aware - this kernel configuration option only makes a driver available for the parallel port. The computer's BIOS sets the mode for the port - ECP, EPP, or Auto. On the majority of modern computers, the Auto mode is the default and will work just fine. However, if you have problems communicating with your printer following a kernel recompile, try changing the mode of your printer in the BIOS. Tomorrow, it's Plug and Play configuration. Netics 2.0 ""Netics is an extensible network statistics collector. It puts the network interface in promiscuous mode and reads the data stream (after it strips off the appropriate protocol headers), then displays the results at specified intervals, either in a ""progress bar"" mode or as raw statistics. Currently, it supports 2 statistics, both involving entropy: LZW compressability and Ueli Maurer's universal statistical test. Maurer's test is a very good and comprehensive measure of entropy, but requires a large amount of data. The LZW statistic requires much less data.""

was just looking at this new application. It shows a graphical
representation of every planet in our solar system (as opposed to
every planet in the Hoth system) and its moons. It also provides
detailed information such as the planet's distance from the sun,
its volume, mass, and gravity in relation to Earth. What I found
most interesting was how long a single 'day' lasts on different
planets. Did you know one day on Pluto is equal to six days on
Earth? I guess he chased Chip and Dale around the Christmas tree

menus, and I thought you might be interested in learning about it.
There are several examples on the company's site, as well as on my
own. Here's a small write-up about it; perhaps you'd be interested
in running this in a future Lockergnome issue? We've all seen a
lot of really cool site navigation menus, with pop-up text, neat
mouseover effects, and the like. Most of them require a
combination of HTML and JavaScript to build, which is expertise
that goes way beyond some of us. At last, it's possible to easily
generate just such a menu with some very user-friendly screens to
enter the data you want to use. Pop-Up Menu comes in a freeware version, or you can get a fully
licensed version ($34.95 for a Home User license / $129.95 for the
Web Designer license). The biggest difference? With the licensed
version, you get the ability to save a menu you've generated so
you can modify it later. Your only alternative, if you want to
make even a simple change to a menu generated by the freeware
version, is to create the whole menu again from scratch (or diving
into the nuts and bolts of the code and modifying that). Be
forewarned: The JavaScript reads like a novel, so modifying that
could potentially be a nightmare. I decided to buy the fully
licensed version and I'm really glad I did. Sorry if I sound like
a commercial for the company; I don't work for them or stand to be
compensated in any way for recommending them. I just think this
menu system is the greatest thing to come along in a while. Avoid intruders in your online space: Our choice to protect your privacy! Complete browsing security.

Who knows how to thwart false charges? Lockergnomie Steve
Lafferty: 'In a recent article over the PayPal issue, it was
stated that when using a credit card illegally, the owner of that
card is responsible for the first $50. However, sometging that
very few people know about is that there is a US Federal provision
in the banking industry called 'Reg E' (Regulation E / Electronic
Funds Transfer). This stipulates that all transactions will err in
favor of the customer (account holder). This means that if your
'bank card' is used without your permission, you are not
responsible for any of the charges. My suggestion is never to use
a credit card - and only use your bank debit card. That way, if
someone steals your number, you are not liable for any of the
charges.' For more information, please refer to Section 205 on
FEDERALRESERVE.GOV. Obviously, this tip only applies to people
living in the USA. If you haven't been watching your statements
like a hawk lately, you'd be wise to start soon. Identity theft is
a growing concern. When my wallet was stolen, I found

Using current, standard HTML and JavaScript, Web builders can make a Web site do almost anything that you could with Microsoft's proprietary code. The only things they can't do are goofy enhancements such as changing the browser scroll bar colors. To solve this compatibility problem, either Web builders have to take proprietary tags out of their sites or users have to use IE to view them.

Here are a few of your answers: ""Doomed. Completely, absolutely, utterly!""
Just about everyone agreed that Audiogalaxy is as dead as Napster. ""Each time a file-sharing service is canceled, a bunch of new ones appear.""
But some people always find a silver lining. ""I might use a file-sharing service for a lot of things, particularly drivers, fixes, and patches.""
A P2P network offering drivers seems like a great idea to me. ""I was an occasional Audiogalaxy participant (birthday CD burned to include songs that were hits the year you were born). Now I'll just opt for a birthday card and a bottle of wine.""
I included this comment because I really like the birthday idea. ""It seems once again rather than release a file download site for music, at a fee per download, the music companies spend money on trying to stop download sites like Audiogalaxy.""
With its popularity, file swapping should be an amazing opportunity for record companies, but they must not be smart enough to figure out how to make it work. http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=27-z9RmzII6499dIu9akMZByjRR83n9asRRUnsubscribe | Manage My Subscriptions | Advertise |

The tough part is remembering everything I'll need. It never fails, though. I always, always, always forget something. I can make lists two weeks in advance and I'll end up 30 miles down the road with a handprint on my forehead when I come to the realization that I left something important behind. What will it be this time, I wonder? I'll let you know on Thursday. Forwarding to Internet Address Fails http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q181636http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q181636 Client inquires about the possibility of forwarding all internal and Internet email to his AOL mailbox when he's out of the office, and I figure it's going to be a piece of cake. He recently acquired a new phone through Verizon along with web access and a tie into his AOL mailbox, which was the driving force behind this request. What I found was that Internet email proved to be easy using a simple forwarding rule, but none of the internal Exchange email was being sent out to the Internet upon receipt, even though it appeared to be included in the rule. As it happens, this is due to a default configuration option on the Exchange 5.5 server that prevents automatic replies/forwards from being sent to the Internet using the Exchange Internet Mail Service. A quick configuration change and restart of IMS will put things right.

Windows XP System File Checker Dean Truax mentioned the System File Checker as a possible solution to my Windows Media Player problem under Windows XP, and I did indeed run through it prior to attempting an in-place upgrade, obviously with no improvement. It's still worth a mention, however, in case you're not familiar with what it's there for. As you're probably aware, XP contains a file protection scheme that will immediate replace any system files that are deleted or altered in any way, ensuring that XP is kept in a stable state. Sometimes this system can get a little out of whack, and the SFC is meant to restore order. Note that any hotfixes and other Microsoft-provided updates will be left in place since they properly update the DLL Cache that is used as the sanity check to determine if a system file has been messed with. To access the SFC, simply launch a command prompt and type ""SFC"" to display a list of options. Consider This Forwarded by JW http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,72519,00.htmlhttp://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,72519,00.html The next time you have a face-to-face with your elected representatives, you might want to start asking about their opinions on technology laws that are being proposed left and right. Holding a public office seems to be introducing brain death more frequently considering proposals by Senator Fritz Hollings and now LA congressman Howard Berman. If Mr. Berman gets his way, companies may very well be allowed to hack into your systems without proof of provocation in order to ensure that you are using their software according to the stated rules. Mind you, if they cause colateral damage or upset other systems, there isn't thing one you can do in return. Nope, they'll have legal protection. This garbage is seriously getting scary. If you think it won't be abused, consider the case of Dimitry Skylarov when he publicly pointed out eBook security problems with Adobe's software and was promptly thrown in jail for his trouble under the authority of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act.

Lockergnome Apple Core <subscriptions@lockergnome.com>,[Lockergnome Apple Core]  Skip Content," 20020709 Lockergnome Apple Core http://www.lockergnome.com/ Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. http://www.gnomedex.comRegister for Gnomedex today! I've finally done it! Lockrgnome's Top 50 http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/cat_macintosh.htmlMac OS X Tips is in publication and available for purchase at GnomeTomes.com. Less than half the tips have appeared in the Apple Core newsletter already, so purchasing them means getting mostly brand new content. This represents the first thing I've written that people might actually pay to read, so if we sell one copy, I'll be ecstatic. And hopefully, any of you who check out the tips will find them useful. I know that figuring out how to do each of the 50 things on the list has improved my personal OS X experience. Although this newsletter started out with Chris, Randy, and I writing sections of the newsletter, time constraints have limited the contributions of the other two guys. This does not mean either of them is truly less involved, it just means I'm doing more writing. Both Chris and Randy regularly send me links to cool Mac stuff they find, much of which will ultimately end up in upcoming issues. Since the writing will be primarily mine, I've opted to eliminate the ""Review by"" links at the bottom of each article. Unless otherwise noted, you can safely assume I wrote it. If you need to send me an e-mail, the E-mail The Editors Link in the sidebar will reach me, as well as putting your message in front of Chris and Randy. I've been doing some exploring of AppleScript over the past several months and believe I'm finally confidant enough in writing scripts that I'm going to add a section on scripting to the newsletter. I'm curious to know what your level of experience with scripting is, because I can either start with some really basic stuff, or skip the basics and dive into meatier scripting topics. Either way, I'm open to some mailto:jake@lockergnome.com?subject=AppleScriptAppleScript suggestions. Sherlock Plugins v2.2 [600k] Mac OS 9/OSX FREE http://www.searchstandard.com/http://www.searchstandard.com/ While doing some research for my top 50 tips, I discovered that turning off some of Sherlock's extras, like multi-language indexing, in the preferences will speed things up considerably, particularly for local machine searches. This renewed my interest in finding ways to add-on search capabilities to the bundled sleuth, resulting in my discovery of SearchStandard.com. This bundled collection of search plug-ins makes it possible to look for almost anything using Sherlock. Their Web site won't wow you, but SearchStandard's free plugins most certainly make finding things online, including searches on your favorite Mac sites, that much easier. Xnet v1.0.6 [216k] OSX $48 http://bitcom.ch/products-xnet-e.htmlhttp://bitcom.ch/products-xnet-e.html Dealing with servers that offer mission critical services, like intranet access, e-mail, or Web serving, means dealing with those services failing from time to time. Don't be left in the dark when one of your services go down, let Xnet keep you informed. The unregistered version of the product lets you verify http, ping, smtp, and ftp service availability, with many more service verifications included in the pro version. Xnet runs on your local machine, verifying remote service availability and sending you a message when those services go down. The interface allows for user-defined services, with alert features for both an e-mail account (mine alerts are going to my cell phone) and locally via a sound from your machine. For OS X installs with multiple users, there may come a time when you need to change ownership of a particular file. This is particularly useful in situations where one user created a file, but an entirely different user is the only one who will ever make future decisions relating to that file, like whether to keep it or throw it in the Trash. chown is the Terminal command designed to handle this. From the command line type: sudo chown username filename You'll of course want to substitute the username of the new owner for username. The name of the file receiving a change of ownership will replace filename. 50 LINUX TIPS: From the mind behind the Penguin Shell come two more eBooks in the GnomeTome series. Whether you are a Linux newbie or command line guru, you'll want these tips as part of your information arsenal. http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/cat_linux.htmlGet your copy of Tony's Top 50 PenguinTWEAKS or Top 50 PenguinCORE tips today! Susan Kare http://www.kare.comhttp://www.kare.com As we move further into the future of Apple's Mac OS evolution, it remains important to understand where things evolved from. Susan Kare designed all the original icons for the Mac OS, way back in 1983. In fact, that smiling Mac that appears as OS X boots is her creation. Check out her collection of UI artwork, from both Windows and Mac operating systems. Also available from Kare.com are Kare designed icon apparel and collections of fonts as designed by Susan. Show Info gives you access to change the application associated with a particular file type, rename files, and reassign permissions. One of the best features of Show Info is it's ability to store ""comments"" related to a file or application. This can be a great place to store information on recently made changes to a file, information from others who've looked at a file, or in the case of applications, serial numbers and other pertinent data you may need when dealing with tech support.

This control provides a registration system that produces a valid serial number customized to the user's machine. When the user installs your software, a unique ID number is generated for that system. To get the serial number, the user must provide you with his installation number. The data file created by the application is encrypted differently for each system, so even if someone were to crack the file, they couldn't use the information on another machine. AppSecure can also give your software shareware functionality such as number of days left, checking to see if the system clock is set back, and so on. AppSecureX works with any ActiveX-enabled programming language such as Microsoft Visual Basic or Microsoft Visual C++. A demo application is included.

In addition to support for SSL, proxy, and authenticated uploading, users can upload and download multiple files using predefined paths to automate the process as much as possible. A scripting language provides for sophisticated customization, and the user interface includes support for 12 different languages. Transfers are faster because the applet uses its own compression (AutoZIP). The AutoSYNC feature downloads only updated files, and verification of file transfer integrity is made possible with built-in support for MD5 message digests. AppletFile is based on HTTP protocols and is firewall-friendly. This update adds Sun's Java Plug-in support for Netscape 6+ browsers and shows removable media drives in the browse dialog.

Lockergnome Windows Daily <subscriptions@lockergnome.com>,[Lockergnome Windows Daily]  Fraud Wipes," 20020711 Lockergnome Windows Daily http://www.lockergnome.com/ GET HIGH-SPEED ACCESS: Verizon Online DSL is an affordable, high-speed Internet connection. http://www.qksrv.net/click-471546-2202776Click here to see if Verizon Online DSL is available in your area. I'm not a banker, and I'm not a credit expert - but these people
speak from personal and professional experience. Draw your own
conclusions. Lockergnomie Sang Vo writes: ""Though you may have
zero liability for a fraudulent transaction, the paperwork and red
tape to work through if someone empties out all your funds can
leave you hurting for a while. There are many credit cards that
now offer zero liability for fraudulent transactions. So, contact
your credit card provider / bank to see if you can have such a
plan added to your card or if you can apply for one that does.""
And Russ Coover continues: ""If you purchase something with a
credit card, and you later decide to dispute the purchase (for a
reason such as the product was faulty and the merchant refuses to
replace it or, perhaps the product was never delivered), you can
legally dispute the charge with your credit card company. However,
if you use a debit card to make that purchase, you have no right
to dispute the charge."" Jeff Morgan has a different interpretation of the regulation in
question (E): ""In 12 CFR II, Section 205.6, it's saying that if
you give your financial institution timely notice of the theft of
your card or PIN code (two business days), you are liable for no
more than $50, otherwise you may be liable for up to $500."" And
Tim Miller extends the translation: ""If someone puts a false
charge on a credit card, the worse that will happen is your
liability for $50, with the possibility that your next charge
might not go through because the thief used all of your available
balance. If a false charge goes against your debit card and wipes
out your bank balance, however, outstanding checks can bounce. Your bank may be able to get you all of your money back, but the
payees of those bounced checks might sock you with $20-25
insufficient fund fees - and they are under no obligation to waive
those fees. If you have 5 checks outstanding, you could be out
over $100."" Frank Reyes was apparently lucky: ""Someone recently obtained my
debit card number through a local grocery store. I was told by the
checker at the grocery store that the card readers would only
accept Visa cards not ATM cards. I was very suspicious, and used
my debit card instead. Apparently, the store's computer had been
hacked, and my debit card number and name (among several
others)were forwarded to an unscrupulous individual. I was
reviewing my checking account online two days later, and noticed
an unauthorized charge against my account ($60.00). I contacted
the vendor that had charged my account and informed them of the
fraudulent charge. The vendor stopped the shipment, provided the
shipping address to my bank, and credited my account within 5 days
after I informed them (The delay in the fund reversal was due to
the 4th of July weekend). The only negative aspect is the fact
that I had to request a new debit card, which has yet to arrive."" Further thoughts from Lockergnomie James Simbro: ""I'm not totally
sure on this, but I've been warned against using a debit card for
online purchases. Yes, you may not be liable for any of the
false charges on a debit card (in the end), but in the meantime
(during your dispute) the money will be withheld from your account
and you will not have access to it. However with a credit card,
you are not responsible for funds that are in dispute. The
scenario I was given, was imagine if somebody falsely used your
debit card and cleaned out your checking account? The money is
gone! False charges on a credit card are not ""real money"" until
somebody has to pay them. I would guess that each bank has
different policies for debit card fraud. I might just have to call
mine and see what I'd face."" In short, be careful - no matter what
you use or where you choose to use your plastic. CYG v20020115 [3.2M] W9x/2k/XP FREE http://www.geocities.com/HoloGuides/CyG/http://www.geocities.com/HoloGuides/CyG/ {Manage your collections} It seems like everyone collects
something. In fact, just the other day I decided to start
collecting dust. It's much easier than collecting stamps. If you
do collect stamps, though, this organizer will help you keep track
of them all. Or you can use it to keep track of your Star Wars
trading card collection, or your coin collection, or your [insert
collection here] collection. It works for everything, get it? It's
also great for managing your MP3 lists, including ID3 tag editing.

Mostly it is useful for sites like FlamingText.com and
ImageBot.com to send generated images to another server (such as

users who can't save images on their own machine. Although we have
no pre-set limits (okay, it's 2.4 GB), the transfers that you do

server is capable of transferring over 1 Gig per minute; if you

To Share or Not to Share Scribbled by Lee Smith I think that online file sharing is dependent on the file that is
being shared. If the song is a current release or recent, then I
do not believe in it. I can't consider it stealing because you
can't steal from someone who willingly puts the file up for
downloading. Those who did put the file online most likely feel
that it is also not stealing, since they purchased the CD.
However, I do not agree with RIAA or recording companies who are
attempting to make their CDs 'rip proof' either. I do not feel
they have the right to dictate what songs I can listen to or when
or in what order. I like to rip specific songs from CDs then make
my own CD, which either goes down to my entertainment system or to
my truck. The master CD is saved and rarely played ('why' is
explained later in this message). I prefer making my own CDs for
my truck because if my truck were to be broken into and my CDs
stolen, it would be much easier to replace a self-burned CD than a
master. Sometimes, masters cannot be replaced without a large
expense, if at all. If the song is outdated, an oldie (so to speak), and is not
available anywhere, then yes, I do believe in it. Or, if the song
being sought is wanted to rejuvenate one's collection, then yes, I
do believe in that, too. Case in point: as a kid, I collected a
lot of 45s and record albums. I have more than 4,000 records in my
collection. Many were played so much that they are not playable
anymore and, even though I did take care of them, due to the cheap
stereos and record players in the 60s, they are 'shot.' I want to
relive some of my younger days through music, but attempting to
convert those records (to digital) is next to impossible for me.
So, in this instance, no, I do not think it is illegal to seek out
digitalized copies of the old songs that I already have records of
(albums and/or 45s). If, however, the song(s) that I am seeking
are available on CD, then I will be very quick to purchase that CD
from Tower Records, The Warehouse, or any other reputable dealer. For those that are impossible to find 'digitals' for, then, one
day, perhaps I will reach a point with technology (and money)
where I can transfer those platters to WAV and they will sound as
good as when they were originally recorded. I have been lucky
enough to find some on CD thanks to the Internet; I was quick to
purchase the disc, usually from the original artists themselves.
Some of the music that I have, sadly, will never be heard again. I
blame RIAA and the recording industry for that, too. Neither seem
to care about the 'lost' songs when digitally remastered CDs are
released.

Who can save you from making a small oversight with your digital
video camera purchase? Lockergnomie Frank Kenna: 'I see that
you're thinking of getting a DV camera. I got one about a month
ago, and I made one mistake: I didn't get one with A/V INPUTS.
Mine has A/V outputs, which are great for getting your digital
stuff out onto VHS, etc. But without the inputs, there's no way to
get VHS or old 8mm footage into the camera. With inputs, not only
can you get your old 8mm & VHS stuff onto DV tapes, but you can
use the camera as a pass-through device and get the old stuff
directly onto your computer for editing purposes. I wish someone
had made clear the advantages and importance of inputs when I
bought my DV camcorder. The reviews and magazines I read barely
mentioned this feature - and nobody stressed its importance. But
if you're going to be doing any editing, it is critical (if you
want to work on any of your old stuff). Don't make the same
mistake I did - make SURE you get this feature. It doesn't seem to
impact the price of the cameras; some offer it and some don't.'
This advice came not a moment too soon for me. Thank you for
helping us, Frank!

お世話になっております。 三菱化学エンジニアリング様のlivelinkログからは
現在、原因が特定できないため
情報を整理し、環境面を含め、問題の切り分けを行なっていきます。
そのために[Service for UNIX]に関して問題がなかったのか
確認させていただきました。 プロセスダウンの要因として、さまざまなケースがありますが
監査機能ロード不具合、CAの不具合以外に
原因の切り分けのため、プロセスダウンの原因となった内容を
報告していただけないでしょうか。 なお、[Service for UNIX]の問題として、Livelinkの使用する環境とは
直接関係ないかもしれませんがお知らせします。 http://www.microsoft.com/japan/support/kb/articles/JP294/3/80.htm
http://www.microsoft.com/JAPAN/support/kb/articles/JP283/0/13.HTM?LN=JA&SD=S
O&FR=0 プロセスダウンが一刻も早く解決できるよう
ご協力お願いいたします。 キヤノン販売（株）

http://seeker.dice.com/jobsearch/jobsearch.epl?rel_code=14IT talent solution
today! I've just got a few quick thoughts today. First, the search is underway for the hosting solution mentioned in Monday's Penguin Shell. The response has been great, with more than two dozen offers of web space for the Foundation for Children and Youth With Diabetes. It gratifying to see our community rally around a great cause. Know that whether you answered the call or not, you're in the electronic company of some caring and compassionate folks. I've not yet heard whether a solution has been found from among the many offered, but I'll certainly keep you posted on the outcome. Second, a few final clarifications on the 4th of July bruhaha. A reader brought to my attention that, though he didn't believe it to be the case, offering my opinion on the state of America could be seen as trolling. That certainly wasn't intended. Also, I've seen much email over the past week that started with, ""Since you published the opinion of someone outside the US, I'd expect that you'll publish an opinion in disagreement."" Well, I did that already - it was my own opinion that started the discussion. I can clearly see the potential for this to get out of hand. So, this will be the last word on the subject. Thanks for your opinions and your discussion, the vast majority of which was well-thought and reasonable. Both sides were presented and we're moving on. On to some Lockergnome news. If you haven't already heard, http://www.evhead.com/"" target=""_blankEvan Williams, and too many others to mention, you'd be silly to miss out. Onward. Have a great day.

Windows Apps in Linux? - Part II I don't want to mince any words, here. http://wine.codeweavers.com/"" target=""_blankWine Project. Using this slick little app, virtually all the applications in the Microsoft Office suite are fully functional in Linux. Frankly, I never thought I'd see the day when running Windows apps in Linux was exciting. Maybe it's time to take up shucking ice cubes in the blasted lands. Let's break this product up a bit. If purchased as a bundle, both CrossOver Office and http://codeweavers.com/products/crossover/"" target=""_blankCrossOver Plugin (as we discussed yesterday) share an install script. They do, however, require separate install processes, so they need to be launched individually from a shared window. I started the CrossOver Office install, dropped my Office 2000 disc in the CD drive, and fired up the install. It looked and performed exactly as you'd expect to see it in Windows. I was able to customize the install, as I always have, then let it run. At the end of the process, CrossOver Office ""fakes"" a Windows reboot and the Office suite installation is complete. Even Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed. There's an option in the CrossOver Office package to install IE 5.5 but, to my chagrin, this was the one area of the install that failed. Actually, the install itself may have succeeded - I was just left without an IE browser following the upgrade. It's hard to tell whether that was a fault in CrossOver Office, or in the IE program itself. For the most part, these apps perform in Linux as they do in Windows. The IE install was a bit kludgy, with some font problems and an inability to customize the toolbar. Word worked perfectly, allowing me even to pull together legal documents for a friend's business without so much as a hiccup. Even printing works well with the installation of a ""Wine Postscript Printer"" driver. Let me reiterate something I said yesterday. I've watched the Wine Project walk, then crawl, then walk again over the past few years. I've always suspected that the fits and starts were not for lack of talent. With the financial backing of CodeWeavers, it appears that my suspicions were well founded. Wine has, through CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin, matured to a level of useability that should easily attract Linux users throughout the spectrum of experience. In the big picture, widespread acceptance of these products could remove the last remaining roadblock for many current Windows users to make the leap to Linux: the loss of Word and Excel. They simply don't need to fear those losses any more. A note on the ""for pay"" structure of these products seems in order. As you well know, I'm an open source guy through and through. But, this is clearly a case in which the ""free"" efforts of talented and dedicated developers simply wasn't enough to close the gap. The value of these products easily outweighs their minimal cost. And, if it keeps these developers moving forward, it seems to be the perfect pay model for Linux. Kernel Configuration - Part X Today we're looking into the mysteries of Plug and Play support in your Linux kernel configuration. There's really not much mystery to it. This section simply asks the question, ""Do you want plug and play support in the kernel?"" In other words, do you have all the PCI and ISA devices in your system that you'll ever need to have? If you're set solid with your current machine, there's no use to add the overhead of PnP to your system's kernel code, or as a loadable module. If, on the other hand, you've got PCI or (on an older system) ISA slots just begging to be filled, build this support into the kernel or select it as modules. See, this kernel gig isn't really so tough. In fairness, we're hitting the high points without a heady discussion of the hidden workings. The discussion of PnP alone could comprise a full series in Penguin Shell. But, so far, the configuration has been pretty straightforward. Tomorrow, we will dive a bit deeper, with a discussion of block device kernel configuration. LiquidWar http://www.ufoot.org/liquidwar/http://www.ufoot.org/liquidwar/ ""Liquid War is a truly original multiplayer wargame. You control an army formed with thousands of pixels (fighters) which look like liquid and try to eat your opponent. You can play against a primitive NPC/AI or up to 5 other human players. Network play is available."" Gnome 2 Installation Notes ""As always, am loving the newsletter. I've been getting it since day one,
and I love all the stuff that you have put in it. ""Just a quick word about the Gnome2 installation. At least so far in my
installation wonders, I have noticed that you need to install intltool (#15)
before scrollkeeper (#3), as it is required in order to build. Thanks again for a great newsletter."" Linmodems.org http://www.linmodems.org/http://www.linmodems.org/ Linmodems.org is a full-featured site on modem hardware and setup in Linux. This has always been a point of friction with Linux users - finding that the machine you've just coverted doesn't have a Linux-compatible modem, or finding modem configuration to be too difficult. Linmodems.org takes on both these issues with skill and ease. The site includes discussion on hardware, software and chipsets. It also links to sites to walk you through the process of setting up a winmodem in Linux. This is a great resource of your main connection to the e-universe is via a dialup connection.

For the time being, you can get it absolutely free, with the caveat that I'd appreciate some feed back on what could be added to make it more useful (I'm considering some screen shots for it if I get some time). What are you waiting for -- http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/cat_audio.htmlget something free already. With the expiration of Lockergnome's old cell phone plan, Lori and I opted to make a switch to Verizon, at the recommendation of Brian Stevens. I'm already happy with the suggestion, as our previous provider had horrid customer service, not to mention I now have a much geekier phone in the form of the http://www.kyocera-wireless.com/kysmart/kysmart_series.htmKyocera QCP 6035 Palm powered unit. It's just larger than most Palm devices on the market, but having the device integration is nice. It has all the functionality of a Palm, with some Internet browsing capabilities and of course, phone access. A built in speakerphone actually works better than I expected, Now all I need to do is get more applications installed. Of interest to anyone who signed up for http://mp3.lockergnome.comemusic after Chris and I talked the service up and down last week: It seems they've added in the ballpark of 1,000 Universal titles to their roster of offerings. Not surprising considering they're part of the same conglomerate, but still good news in terms of feature expansion. GIF Movie Gear v3.02 [1129k] W9X/NT/W2K/XP $40 http://www.moviegear.com/gmgdet.htmhttp://www.moviegear.com/gmgdet.htm The majority of GIF animation on the Web does absolutely nothing for me. I'm of the mindset that animation is meant to either tell a story or illustrate a concept -- not put something in motion just because you can. That said, for anyone wanting to create animations, this tool makes it nice and easy. A storyboard interface keeps you thinking like a movie maker as you build your animated creations, which lends itself to helping anyone who'd like to get from point A to point B in an orderly fashion. The software supports PSD, JPG, AVI, BMP, and GIF formats, leaving your options open for creating animated segments. Madshrimps Extreme CDROM Testing http://www.madshrimps.com/index-e.php?action=webnews-e&l1=0&l2=30http://www.madshrimps.com/index-e.php?action=webnews-e&l1=0&l2=30 A little on the childish side, but this CD-Rom drive test is still very funny. Watch as this group rewrites the rules on drive benchmarking. If geek TV were more like this, even non-geeks would tune in to watch (which probably says more than it should about the lowest common denominator). A WMV capable player is required,.

The product is shareware, but you are on your honor to register, as there is no expiration or nagging from the software. Tapeheads (R) 1988 Comedy - 93min Reviewer's Tilt (2) Two out of work rent-a-cops make an attempt to break into the music video industry in this quirky comedy. John Cusack and Tim Robbins make this comedy work, starring as the two security guards as they send up all sorts of Hollywood stereotypes. You can't help but laugh at the ridiculous predicaments these two survive, as they are greeted with cameos by a who's who of music and movie industry names. I'm sure neither Robbins nor Cusack would openly list this movie on a resume, but it is indeed a brilliant performance by both of them, especially as a demonstration of their ability to play off of each other. Although this is a late 80's release (one of the few 80's underground classics I hadn't previously seen), it remains relevant to those out there who are looking to put it to the man. If you've ever hated the recording industry and its in-crowd attitude, you'll love this film. A closing reference to Rene's Courtyard Cafe in Santa Monica, which is a regular stop for me every time I'm in the LA area, prompted me to want to watch the film for a second viewing. The movie is humorous enough for several viewings. Nothing really grabs attention on the DVD, but then again, the studio probably expects no one will buy it anyway.

Read my full commentary Oracle challenges Microsoft anew Oracle is taking on Microsoft's Exchange with a Collaboration Suite that includes e-mail, calendar and messaging software. Oracle has pitched its products as Microsoft replacements before -- with spectacularly little success. (At Comdex last November, the database giant offered its 9i and app-server software as a more secure alternative to Exchange.) What's different this time? Oracle is selling a separate collaboration product that, says CEO Larry Ellison, is cheaper than rival offerings. Plus: Companies facing a deadline to join Redmond's new licensing program may be more open to non-Micrososft alternatives.

If patented technology is rejected, the vote could mark a major shift in the Internet standards battle. Major intellectual property holders such as Microsoft and IBM have a lot at stake.

Lockergnome Tech Specialist <subscriptions@lockergnome.com>,[Lockergnome Tech Specialist]  Geothermal Caffeine," 20020711 Lockergnome Tech Specialist http://www.lockergnome.com/ CHRIS TEACHES THE BASICS: If you've got friends or family who want to learn more about their PC, from a guy who makes things nice and easy, check out the VHS release of http://www.lockergnome.com/lgstore/sunshop/index.php?action=item&id=68get them a copy today. Wednesday's trip went fairly smooth overall, and I actually enjoyed helping out my friend Larry with some server software installation and network configuration tasks. His kids seemed impressed with the new ability to copy files between the five different computers and have Internet access at any of them. Ahh, yes... geeks in the making. After that project was finished, I met up with Jake at a nearby Starbucks to shoot the breeze and catch up on all things Lockergnome. We email all the time, but it's nice to have a face-to-face conversation for a change. He had just finished establishing new phone service with Verizon, so he has a fun new PalmOS-based phone to play with. After the dose of caffeine, I headed up to Boone, Iowa to hook up with my cousin Casey and his wife of two months, Stephanie. Their new house is awesome, but disappointing, as there was no high-speed Internet connection or wireless networking. We'll have to fix that. For now, I'll remain impressed with the geothermal heating/cooling system and the vast potential of the unfinished basement that will someday make an incredible rec room [insert suitable Tim Allen grunt here]. Casey is ticked about all of the rain recently because it keeps eroding his dirt front yard into the drainage ditch. The back yard is in great shape, as there was sod laid after construction finished up, but he decided to save a few bucks and seed the front himself next spring. This now assumes that he'll have a front yard left by then. The rain turned out to be the last event of the evening. I drove through the beginning of the storms on the way from Ankeny to Boone, and I just knew it was going to be a rough drive home later since they were only getting started at that time. I was correct. What would normally be an hour and 45 minute drive turned into nearly two and a half hours and many, many animal sightings. As the night wore on, I was half expecting to see someone building an ark in a cornfield. Must have been where the animals were headed. The rain guage at home showed 3.25"" this morning, adding to the 1.25"" and 2.5"" amounts dumped out of it within the last week. I considered setting the sprinkler up in the front yard today as an attempt at neighborly humor, but figured I'd just be labeled as a complete moron instead. So, what did I forget to take with me, you ask? Directions to Larry's house. DOH! I had to dig out the notebook at a close rest area in a vain attempt to quickly memorize the route. Instead, I decided to transcribe the list on my Jornada, which would be far easier (and safer) to read as I navigated through the streets. There's still a use for printers in this world, without question. Reading text from the tiny screen bites. Larger print and bold text on a sheet of paper is the way to go. At least I didn't leave my PDA at home as well, which I actually considered doing. Satellite Internet Delays Add Up http://www.skycasters.com/supervpnwhitepaper.htmhttp://www.skycasters.com/supervpnwhitepaper.htm Have you considered moving to a satellite Internet provider at some point? While all of the marketing hype paints a rosy picture, there are a couple of things that you really must consider before writing the check. The birds are some 23,000 miles above the surface of the planet, so there is a significant delay while the bits float up and back down. The absolute minimum time for a packet to get from one place to another is nearly a quarter of a second. Add in hops across the Internet and other hardware latency and it's common to see ping times of between 500 and 1000 milliseconds - an eternity when you're talking about TCP/IP connections. Now consider how VPN connections are affected, being that they are generally significantly slower on the ground without the extra 46,000 miles. Ouch! This white paper is a tad marketing driven, but I think their explanation of technology and how they are addressing VPN-
over-satellite connections is quite informative. PGP Outlook Plug-in Vulnerability http://www.nai.com/naicommon/download/upgrade/patches/patch-pgphotfix.asphttp://www.nai.com/naicommon/download/upgrade/patches/patch-pgphotfix.asp Even encryption software is potentially exposed to security problems. Network Associates' PGP software, which interfaces directly with Microsoft Outlook, has been found to be vulnerable to malicious code within an email. Exposed systems can be made to execute code of the attacker's choice, and because email can be sent from anywhere and to anywhere. Tracking down the source could be rather difficult. Hotfixes for each of NAI's products are available on their website.

Intro to Relational Databases http://www.15seconds.com/issue/020522.htmhttp://www.15seconds.com/issue/020522.htm You know what a database is, right? Sure you do. Can you explain what a relational database is all about? Correctly? There's a lot more to database management and development than dumping a bunch of records into tables and generating reports. Proper design is crucial. Trust me. I've been on the receiving end of some lazy programming efforts that ignore the foundation of relational databases, and it usually results in additional work later. Smile While You Surf I like creative use of 404 pages, so sue me. Some of you have complained about the one Chris created for display when you come across a bogus link on the Lockergnome web site, which I don't understand. Would you rather stare at that stupid-looking, uninformative and generally useless one that your browser provides by default? Cramsession.com posted some unique ""excuses"" for their site being down for maintenance, and I thought I'd share a few: Roses are red Our web site is resting We're fixing the server While Everquesting In the interest of research, we're testing to see how long it takes a Network Administrator to get through a people-size maze to the web servers. As soon as he finds them, we'll be back online... Unless the Marketing Minotaur gets him first. Suicide note found on the web server: ""I've had it. I can't take the heat anymore. You ran me ragged, and what thanks did I get? None. Null. Nothing. I gave and I gave, and you still wanted more I spent every second of my day trying to make you happy, but it was never enough. Always work faster, do more, stay late, work overtime, be more efficient. I was never good enough for you anyway. You deserve better. Signed CPU."" You have reached the Cramsession Maintenance Page.
While you are staring at this page, waiting for the website to come back up, (should take about an hour or two) We'd like to offer the following fun activities: Hold your breath until you see black spots dancing in front of your eyes. Spin around in your chair until you get nauseous. Wheee! Pretend your mouse is a microphone. Dictate a memo into it where you outline your plans for global domination.
Connect the dots! . . . . . . . Get monitor cleaner so you can wipe ink off of screen from connecting the dots. We apologise for the inconvenience of our missing web site. We're doing something really ""high tech"" and ""important"" behind this ""maintenance"" curtain. We'll be back just as soon as we catch all the gophers.....Again. HELP! I'm locked in the Server Room. Please send Help! And I'm running out of potato chips, too!

Somehow, it never got mentioned that Lockergnome has a GnomeTome for all you http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001691.htmlDreamweaver users out there. Dennis Jarrett, a gnomie from the UK with a prolific list of writing accomplishments, lent his brain to a list of things everyone should know to make using Dreamweaver 4 (and newer) easier to use. I 've never actually used version 4, having stuck with 3 until recently starting the review process of the StudioMX suite, but I've been able to apply every tip I tried to some aspect of DreamweaverMX, so I can only guess those of you using 4 will want to http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001691.htmlcheck 'em out too. As I mentioned in yesterday's Digital Media newsletter, I recently switched cell phones to the http://www.kyocera-wireless.com/kysmart/kysmart_series.htmKyocera QCP6035. The unit is Palm powered, with a screen the size of an m105 and all the functionality of Palm OS, in addition to having the latest bells and whistles you'd want in a phone. Built in Web browsing, by way of MSN, is slightly cumbersome compared to what I'm used to from my cable connection, but I can already see the usefulness in carrying around portable access to things like driving directions. Now that I've got a way to test the final results in real time, I've got a more vested interest in making Lockergnome considerably more WAP compatible. I'm still figuring out many of the phone's features, so that's still going to be at least a few weeks away. Without a doubt, I'll be sharing my experiences in WAPing Lockergnome in an upcoming series of articles. phpMyNewsletter http://gregory.kokanosky.free.fr/phpmynewsletter/http://gregory.kokanosky.free.fr/phpmynewsletter/ As a free solution for managing newsletters, for smaller lists, this does most of what you need. Subscribers are stored in a mySQL database, with the ability to send user confirmation e-mails. Initially, the address must still be added manually to the database, which isn't idea, but doing this generates a confirmation e-mail with a link that users click on if they want to be added. The software purges addresses with no response, following an administrator defined waiting period. From the php interface you can send either text or HTML formatted messages, with a built-in preview to make sure your formatting is OK. Documentation is somewhat sparse, so prior knowledge of php and mySQL are useful in getting this installed. OpalisRobot v4.0 [60MB] NT/W2k/XP http://www.opalis.comhttp://www.opalis.com Think of this as something like ""cron for Windows"" only even more powerful. OpalisRobot allows you to schedule almost any process on your server, adding an additional layer of functionality, like the ability to program telephony commands to complete administrative tasks. OpalisRobot effectively processes e-mail commands, in addition to telephone DTMF tones, making everything on your server administerable from remote locations, even when you can't get remote control access of the machine. Programming jobs is point-click simple, saving you time even when you schedule tasks to save you time. If you operate in a Windows server environment, you're adding extra hours to your day and costing your company additional dollars by not having this software.

The 30 days are nearing their end, which means you won't have to wait to find out what's next; you can simply click to the next page. Mark Pilgrim, the site's creator, sets the stage with 5 characters (all of which could easily represent real people) and walks through their physical, mental, and technological limitations. Following the character introductions, Mark walks through an accessibility scenario each day and then relates the concept back specific benefits for each character's limitations. Solutions are presented with blogs in mind, but with very little extrapolation you'll be able to make every site you design more user friendly. Backend.UserLand.Com http://backend.userland.com/http://backend.userland.com/ I've been using Radio from the moment I finally got around to creating a blog. The software keeps things simple and automatically updates itself when new things get added. Userland goes far beyond creating a desktop interface for their blogging system though. They've fully documented all the XML, XML-RPC, and SOAP tie-ins used to connect to their network, which could easily be adapted to other content management applications with some XML knowhow. Backend is the place to look ""under the hood"" at Userland's XML inner workings, including detailed documentation on making everything work.

The tech-packed Nasdaq composite index edged down 0.94 points, or 0.06 percent, to 1,373.49. Broader markets also fell, as investors shrugged off news of better-than-expected retail and food services sales in June. The Dow Jones industrials shed 117 points, or 1.33 percent, to 8,684.5--its fifth straight losing session.

Juniper beat estimates by earning less than $500,000, reported a 42 percent decline in year-over-year sales and offered little hope that it could grow its business when it reported 2002 second-quarter earnings Thursday. Yet in some corners of the industry, Juniper's performance was viewed as mildly positive.

If you've ever taped a ""Seinfeld"" episode or traded music online, Uncle Sam may want you--to stop. Draft legislation that is winding its way through Congress would sharply limit Americans' rights relating to copying music, taping TV shows and transferring files through the Internet. The first part of their proposal, which would http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=8b-SBGBQY0y2oGDikAEYIEElDh4B1FR"" >limit backup copies, has drawn objections from academics and nonprofit groups that have reviewed it. Under current copyright law, Americans who record a TV program or radio segment generally may ""sell or otherwise dispose of"" that analog recording or digital file as they wish. The proposed bill would end that exemption, handing copyright owners substantial new control over the distribution of their works by curtailing a consumer's right to copy material under a doctrine known as ""fair use."" Another salvo in the copyright battle was delivered when a federal judge said that record labels and film studios could http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=a0-11h8QQBqNNjxwbcUByjw2PB1s79R"" >expand an ongoing copyright lawsuit to include Sharman Networks, which distributes the popular Kazaa software. The Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Association of America last October sued three prominent file-swapping companies in Los Angeles federal court. The suit named Morpheus parent StreamCast Networks, Grokster and Kazaa BV, the Netherlands-based company that originally created the Kazaa software. However, in February, Kazaa BV sold the Kazaa file-swapping software to Sharman, a company later revealed to be based in Vanuatu, a small island in the South Pacific. The recording and movie industry trade groups asked permission to add that company to the lawsuit in June. A judge ruled this week that Sharman could be added to the lawsuit. Computer security is becoming http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=b5-50FcQ7U79NyMUQi1PHq15ZNEEZuR"" >increasingly critical to President Bush's proposal for a homeland defense department. When Bush formally proposed the department last month, he never mentioned the Internet or so-called cybersecurity. But as Capitol Hill scrutinizes the proposal, politicians are fretting about tech-savvy terrorists--and insisting any new agency must shield the United States from electronic attacks as well. House Republicans have asked committees for any suggested changes to the White House-backed bill by the end of the week. Included in the proposal are radical changes for the U.S. government's Internet defenses. The plan would stitch together nearly all computer protection functions, from the Commerce Department's Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office to the Computer Security Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to the Federal Computer Incident Response Center. Additionally, the proposed department is likely to get its own http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=ca-iciuQUgF71gRVXMcl8jfOfRHHUsR"" >privacy czar. A draft of the legislation seen by CNET News.com states that the Secretary of Homeland Security must appoint a privacy officer to ensure that new technologies ""sustain and do not erode"" privacy protections and to verify that the agency's massive databases operate within federal guidelines. Perhaps a more immediate security concern to individuals is what is going on now with their computers. Apple Computer OS X users could let hackers http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=df-1kJhQLEFh2TGWRjfbQq-Kh1XhaZR"" >piggyback malicious code on downloads from the company's SoftwareUpdate service. According to the BugTraq mailing list, a hacker named Russell Harding has posted full instructions for how to fool Apple's SoftwareUpdate feature to allow a hacker to install a backdoor on any Mac running OS X. The exploit takes advantage of SoftwareUpdate, Apple's software updating mechanism in OS X, which checks weekly for new updates from the company. According to Harding, who claims to have discovered the exploit, the feature downloads updates over the Web with no authentication and installs them on a system. So far, there are no patches available for this problem. Users of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Outlook and Outlook Express applications http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=f5-lTbRQgwxlE6ooZY6DmLwgkaZmRuR"" >may be vulnerable to a recently discovered software flaw that could leave their system open to malicious code carried on Web pages or in e-mails. A security researcher and partner at risk-assessment company PivX Solutions warned that HTML objects embedded in Web pages and e-mail could carry code that allows an attacker to check out victims' cookie files, read their documents and execute programs on their computer. Still another problem is plaguing Outlook: A popular plug-in that lets users encrypt and digitally sign messages has http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=0a-ZnKCIrrs-4R73PWBwhq6GOxuYzsR"" >inadvertently weakened security and left the mail program open to attack. Security company eEye Digital Security issued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associates' Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerability in the add-on could let attackers execute malicious software on a victim's computer. One of the first cameras that can shuttle photos and videos using the Wi-Fi wireless networking technology has made its http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=1f-rvwqI58wtiBX5xU1xmYgHobjqmZR"" >debut. IQinVision plans to sell the camera to companies such as security firms that need to put video cameras in places where wires can't go, or as a way to quickly install a temporary security system. This product is among the first devices to combine digital videography and wireless LANs (local area networks) that use the Wi-Fi, or 802.11b, standard. Expect more digital camera makers to follow suit. The number of digital cameras has been on the rise, and it's only a matter of time before a camera maker wants to add a popular new technology like Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi is also http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=34-pJpSIcd8ld53rX23_tvVyn4IcgdR"" >invading handheld devices. Wireless equipment maker Intersil is working with SyChip to incorporate 802.11b wireless networking technology into a Secure Digital (SD) card for handheld devices. The card, which should be available to manufacturers for testing in the fourth quarter, lets handheld owners add and remove wireless networking capabilities to handhelds that contain an SD slot from Palm, Hewlett-Packard and other companies. Wireless SD cards would make it far easier for handheld manufacturers and owners to get these devices linked. Only a few handhelds include wireless capabilities, and they are some of the most expensive on the market. With the card, wireless access becomes an option for many. Not everyone is pleased with the explosion in popularity of wireless networking. Broadband providers are http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=49-ZM4cIEpSm4ht0v3VX4RVXFO5JSrR"" >cracking down on some customers, threatening to cut service to those who set up the inexpensive wireless systems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access. After being introduced just a couple of years ago, so-called Wi-Fi ""hot spots"" that tap into cable or digital subscriber lines (DSL) are now in at least 15 million homes and offices. The problem is that one paying subscriber can set up a local network that allows several other people to access the Net, for fun or for profit. As China's society changes and its education system matures, the country is becoming a major consumer and producer of computer products. And as the global recession leaves few fertile opportunities elsewhere, China has emerged as a primary target for foreign business. A News.com three-part http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=5e-ssGdIn0656nzdldhsnStcVTQzciR"" >special report examines the various reasons that this may eventually be known as China's high-tech century.

Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. http://www.gnomedex.comRegister for Gnomedex today! My mom just notified me of my aunt Theresa's death. She was my
father's older sister, though I only knew her through a few e-mail
exchanges and a couple of brief encounters as a child. This news
came hours after I received ANOTHER bit of disturbing news:
""Please tell Chris that one of his first fans died last weekend of
a heart attack at home."" I first met Jon Snyder at an Apple user's
group meeting a couple of years ago; to me, he always looked like
a beefier Robert Beltran. Death is something we all must deal
with, but you never seem to be prepared for it when someone
actually dies. A few months ago, Aunt Theresa sent word that she
had seen my show. It was good to know that even though we hadn't
interacted much over the past few years, she was still able to see
me on TV. And even though you didn't know him, you're closer to
Jon than you realize. Witness this message he sent to his boss a
few months ago: ""I evangelized for months last year for having our company at
the first of these consumer computer conferences in Des Moines
last October, but got shot down. The conference was a hit despite
being postponed by 9/11, and having to move the venue at the last
minute. I know... I was there. So, I'm starting all over again
being 'pushy' about our presence at this event in August of this
year. Chris Pirillo, whose Des Moines-based commercial email
publishing group 'Lockergnome' puts this conference together, is a
friend of mine. He was the 'kid' hired by TechTV to host their
Call for Help daily TV program in SF starting last fall. If you
get the Dish network or Mediacom cable you can catch his show. I
have my DishPlayer set up to record his show on a daily basis.
It's VERY well done, as is TechTV as a whole."" I returned from speaking to another http://www.dvpc.org/user group the other night and
found that approximately 100 new GnomeTomes had been ordered.
Sweet! When I started looking closer at the numbers, I realized
that Jake was offering his http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/cat_audio.htmlConverting
Vinyl LPs to CD eBook for free - and that's all anybody was
taking. No, seriously - five hundred orders later, and 99% of them
were just for that particular title. Now, while I don't have a
problem with Jake's offer, I do want to encourage you to check out
the non-free titles (and if you've already looked, please
http://www.gnometomes.com/look again). A lot of blood,
sweat, and tears went into them - and they're just as helpful. In
fact, Jake's also written one for http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001924.htmlOS X (which
probably wouldn't impress you if you weren't using an Apple
machine). Although, I'm sure plenty of you use

you to give it another glance. After all, as http://members.aol.com/voicepro/Elwood

The Evidence is Against You Scribbled by Jim Girard Every time some new technology has expanded free access to popular
music, starting with radio broadcasts of recorded songs in the
1930s, the recording industry has fought it - claiming that it
would cost them money. And every time, it has resulted in
increased sales. The best-known example, of course, was the
advances in tape cassette technology in the 60s and 70s, including
Dolby sound technology. As with MP3, this technology was opposed
by the music industry as different from previous such
developments, because it made it possible for ordinary people to
create their own copies at near-professional quality. The actual
result was the creation of a whole new profit center for the music
industry - pre-recorded cassette tapes - which actually became
more popular than vinyl for a while (before the advent of CD
technology). The thing is, the music industry is well aware of this effect - and they are not really aiming to stop the private exchange of
songs in MP3 format. If that were their goal, they'd be
instituting widespread, aggressive legal actions against all the
server-centered nodes (as they did against all radio stations
playing their music in the 30s, when they really thought the
phenomenon was going to wipe them out). Instead, they have focused
on the best-known services - first Napster, then Morpheus, KaZaA,
and most recently, Audiogalaxy. Even in those cases, they've
limited their legal challenges to things they know they can win - and they've avoided actual court trials whenever possible (to
avoid the possibility of setting some damaging precedent). The point that seems to escape a lot of people is that copyright
is not a property in the same sense as most of the things we think
of as property. One key difference is that if you don't defend it,
you lose it. If you left your car sitting in the driveway, with
the window open and the keys in the ignition, and somebody drove
away in it, that would still be theft - and you'd still be
entitled to get your car back. Not so with copyright. If you are
aware of infringement and you do nothing to try to stop it, you
are voluntarily allowing it to enter the public domain. It's for
the same reason that big companies insist that newspapers put a
copyright or trademark symbol after the names of their products
whenever they're mentioned, and not use words like 'Coke' or
'Kleenex' as generic terms. They don't really expect everybody to
do what they say - and they're well aware that having the name of
one's product become the generic term for a product is actually a
great marketing boon. But if they DON'T do that, someone at some
point could start using the word on their own product, arguing
that it is in the public domain. The efforts of the music industry are not aimed at actually
stopping the exchange of music between individuals - which they
know from long experience, increases their sales because most of
the people who normally buy the music aren't really satisfied with
near-perfect copies. For most of them, the learning curve and the
cost in time of creating those copies themselves outweighs the
cost of simply buying the CD. Most of the outright piracy is
committed by people who wouldn't have bought the music in the
first place. What the music industry is doing is clearly aimed at
establishing a public record of their efforts to defend copyright,
in the broadest, most public way; to prevent anyone from making a
legal claim that the stuff they own has entered the public domain.
The thing they're really worried about, in terms of profits, is
the change in the marketing model. Even legitimate online music
commerce threatens the album format, with its traditional mix of a
few good songs and a bunch of others most people wouldn't pay for
if they were buying the stuff song by song. The problem is how to
make as much money on a per-song basis - and, at the moment, it
requires charging far more for an individual song that most people
are willing to pay. At any rate, copyright is actually a fairly complex matter of
civil law, with a good deal of history behind it - dating back to
the Renaissance. The strategies music companies use are clearly
directed to realities and necessities, in light of history and
case law. They have also done a great PR job, convincing the most
technically knowledgeable people on the Internet that it is a
simple moral or criminal issue. 'Common sense' tells a lot of
people that copying music without paying for it is just like
stealing someone's car, and represents a loss to the owner. But if
common sense could decide the issue equitably, we wouldn't have
the law in the first place. Most of our great intellectual
systems, including not only law but science, are designed in large
part to overcome the errors of common sense, and that is more the
case in civil law than criminal. The people who work within those
systems are well aware of that, but they are also well aware that
most people aren't - and that it can work to their advantage. Any
time a highly paid civil attorney begins by telling you that an
issue vital to his client is actually very simple, or just a
matter of common sense, there's a very high probability that what
he means is that it's to his clients advantage if people like you
believe that. If it really WERE that simple, the client wouldn't
be paying him as much as he is. A BOOK FOR EVERY GEEK: Want to know more about http://www.gnometomes.comClick here to learn more. My Virtual Model http://www.myvirtualmodel.com/http://www.myvirtualmodel.com/ {Make a model of you} Wouldn't it be cool if you could physically

Who has no trouble with controling his codes? Lockergnomie Wayne
Smith: 'Here is a bit of information specifically for Hotmail
users who may have trouble opening your links, due to the service
wanting to place the referred URL in a separate frame. I receive
my Lockergnome newsletters via Hotmail and find it really useful
when you folks include the link as text. However, sometimes this
isn't practical - or it stops the flow of the article. The trouble
here is that the link sometimes returns the message: 'There was an
error displaying this link' in the frame. No problem! Right-click,
copy shortcut, paste to metapad (freeware from LIQUIDNINJA.COM),
then do a global search and replace. The trick is to replace the
control codes with the correct characters: %26 is an ampersand;
%3a is a colon; %2e is a period; %20 is a blank space; %2f is a
forward slash; %3d is an equals symbol; %3f is a question mark.
The Windows character map can help with any others. Select a
character, look at the status bar, replace 'U+[code]' with the
percent sign. In other words, the ampersand (U+0026) is %26 which
translastes into a '&' symbol. Maybe a more clever Gnomie can come
up with some script which we can place in the 'Web' folder,
correctly register, and use in IE's right-click / context menu?'

10000.htmlstartling revelation that Microsoft refuses to use their own ISA Server to protect themselves from the very things the product is meant to stop - worms and intrusion. Nimda was turned loose within Microsoft and they've chosen NetScreen's 500 series security appliance to cure what ills them. I find this staggeringly hilarious, to say the least. The move is tantamount to Intel deploying desktops based on AMD processors! Ok, so a hardware solution might be better than a software defense in many cases. I suppose we can't entirely blame Microsoft for opting to go that route. Probably a wise decision, in fact - admit defeat and move on. However, why is Nimda spreading within the corporate walls to the point that they felt the needed to make such a leap in the first place? After all, patches were released months ago, so IIS is impervious to attack now. Still considering the deployment of IIS as your web server platform of choice? Things that make you go hmmmm... SQL Server Install Leaves Passwords Behind http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-035.asphttp://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-035.asp During the installation of SQL Server 7.0 or 2000, various bits of configuration information are stored in a setup.iss file, including account passwords that have been captured in order to configure the services. Prior to certain service packs, these passwords are stored as clear text, which is problematic because the file is left on the hard drive after the installation process is completed. Peruse the details of the bulletin to be sure you've cleaned up any relevant bits and pieces applicable to your environment. SQL Server Cumulative Patch http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-034.asphttp://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-034.asp A new roll-up patch is available for SQL Server that takes care of all previous security issues, plus a trio of new items. Two buffer overrun vulnerabilities exist that could allow an attacker to gain control over the server, and a different privilege elevation flaw can be exploited due to improper permissions within the registry. All three are spackled over by the latest cumulative patch described further in this bulletin. Win2K Memory Allocation Adjustments Unearthed by Wayne Clark http://searchwin2000.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid1_gci835208,00.htmlhttp://searchwin2000.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid1_gci835208,00.html Most Windows 2000 servers tune themselves fairly well and do not need further tweaking. In those cases, it's best to just leave things alone unless you specifically identify a problem somewhere. Serdar Yegulalp has an excellent explanation of one particular situation where memory pools can be exhausted and crash the server. Before you go diving into the registry to play with the knobs and buttons, be certain you know what you're messing with or you could just make things worse. Backups, backups, backups.

If you have a handle on your network configuration, it's much easier to manage. IP addresses are one bit of information that must be properly tracked, but often it's a manual effort to enter and sort data. Using the script techniques provided in this brief article, you can convert an address to a 32-bit number, perform the sort, then convert back to the standard dotted decimal format. An Excel sample spreadsheet is also provided to get you started. Broadband Sharing Crackdown http://news.com.com/2100-1033-942323.htmlhttp://news.com.com/2100-1033-942323.html Those of us with wireless networking equipment might be tempted to allow the neighbors to share the wealth, but be careful. Broadband companies are catching on and putting a stop to the practice. What's concerning to me is that I don't share my wireless network, but I do use quite a few different machines at any given time. If someone is snooping around and seeing a lot of different sessions and gets curious, might I be subject to a teeth-kicking? Virtual Sketching Discovered by Diana http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze2mfh8/http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze2mfh8/ I believe I still have an old Etch-A-Sketch in a box somewhere.

Lockergnome Windows Daily <subscriptions@lockergnome.com>,[Lockergnome Windows Daily]  Deeper Uplink," 20020715 Lockergnome Windows Daily http://www.lockergnome.com/ CHRIS TEACHES THE BASICS: If you've got friends or family who want to learn more about their PC, from a guy who makes things nice and easy, check out the VHS release of http://www.lockergnome.com/lgstore/sunshop/index.php?action=item&id=68get them a copy today. It's official: Gretchen, Sprocket, and I will be moving in a few
weeks. Not too far, though. We'll be going deeper into the city of
San Francisco starting on the first of September. Lori and Norm
were here over the weekend (for a photo shoot); in between sets,
Gretchen invited them to join her hunt. They came upon a house
located in one of the busier parts of town. With only street
parking available, I wasn't too thrilled about investigating the
property. However, my wife seemed optimistic. We kinda knew what
we were looking for in a residence (and its neighborhood), but
also knew we'd have to make certain concessions in the process. We
parked (literally) up the hill and found our way to what would
turn out to be our future home (at least, for the next year or
so). It has lots of usable space - which is a premium here. Plus,
the landlords are extremely dog-friendly. Winner! The pictures and
videos will come, never fear. PC World Picks First order of business: get broadband! According to AT&T's Web
site, cable modem service is not available in the area. However,
DSL is an option. So, it looks like I'm going to be purchasing an
external http://lockergnome.pricegrabber.com/search_gen.php?form_keyword=dsl%20modemDSL
modem in a few days. Any suggestions?
Yeah, I'm not even sure who I'll select for my provider. They
currently use SBC to get online, so I might just stick with them
for continuity's sake. Verizon has been solid enough for me here,
but I believe our loft complex has a unique infrastructure. If I
could make contact with someone from any capable system, I'd
probably go with them. I should probably get the ball rolling
soon, though - I'd hate to play the waiting game for too long.
I've heard of installation nightmares, so I'll probably be rolling
my own (again). 56k is quaint, but hardly enough pipe to get any
real work done. When you download as much as I do, every bit
counts. Oh, and did I tell you about the bites? There are plenty of unique restaurants in just about every
direction. Plus, we're right up around the corner from a Peet's
outlet! If you need me, you know where you can find me. I'll
probably also be setting up a Wi-Fi network before too long, too.
My Proxim hardware still works, but I wasn't sure if I needed a
crossover cable to connect it to my router. Furo tells me: ""If the
hub has an uplink port, then a straight cable should work between
the two, as it provides the crossover for you. If both have uplink
and non-uplink ports (workstation attachment ports), then you
would need a crossover cable between like ports. For instance, if
you were connecting a workstation port on one to a workstation
port on another, you'd have to use a crossover. Same for uplink to
uplink."" How's that for home network helpfulness? Oh, if only he'd

drives of mine? I'm always curious about what has been downloaded
to my PC after I have visited a website. I suppose I COULD clear
out my Temporary Internet Files before going to every single
page... or I could just install Traces Viewer. This handy
application gives me the power to see what my PC acquires for
every website I visit. With Traces Viewer's easy-to-read
interface, I can see what files come from each site, and also if
the site contained any cookies. Mmmmmm, cookies... now, how could

original desktop and icons in Windows to a version that mirrors my
personality. So what happens if I can't find a desktop or set of
icons that suits me? I load up Pixel Toolbox! This program allows
me to flex my creative skills by creating Windows icons and
pointers. Find yourself in a creativity slump? Well, you don't
have to strain your creative muscle. PixelToolbox allows you to
import an image that you already own, and work from there. If that
isn't enough, you can fashion your own tiled desktop or share your
creation with friends by exporting your masterpiece as a .jpg,

piece of software you own with this application; you can attach an
image of your paper receipt, add information like serial numbers
and activation keys, etc., so you will never be left hunting for
these items in the future. SAPP can even create and print reports
detailing your inventory. If you own a small company and want to

with the Software Audit Protection Program! Print! v1.6 [319k] W9x/2k/XP US$39 Unearthed by Rob Muller http://www.robsoftware.com/http://www.robsoftware.com/ {Screen print utility} Time is money, and I endorse any program
that can save me time. Luckily, that is exactly what Print! v1.6
does. Say that I want to share screenshots with my other tech
friends to compare error messages and talk about possible fixes:
every time I take a screen shot, I open up Word, paste the
snapshot, and THEN I can print it. Too many steps, too much of my
time! With Print!, I just hit my ""Print Screen"" key and out comes
my screenshot without involving any other programs. Don't want a
screenshot of your whole desktop? Not a problem, just press Alt +
Print Screen and you'll have a printout of the active window only.
Print! 1.6 goes so far as to put the date and time on your
printout too... perfect for saving those high scores on solitaire!
Other features include scaling, centering, and the ability to
invert images. (So, not only will you save time, you'll also save
on toner. Bonus!) You may also want to note that Print! saves
your printer configuration without wreaking havoc on the settings
in your other programs. You'll definitely get your money's worth
with this program. Don't believe me? Start by checking out the
evaluation version for yourself! REMOTE ACCESS TO YOUR E-MAIL: LoudPC is a new product from Loudfire enabling direct access to your PC's Outlook(tm) from any Internet browser or web phone.

that she can't throw away. For example, books. I, on the other
hand, prefer my text in an electronic medium, and don't really
miss those analog versions. (What's that stuff called again?
Paper?) Many of my books are gathering dust on the bookshelf. The
alternative? Free them into the wild! BookCrossing is essentially
a worldwide book club. You register online and get a BookCrossing
ID number to put on your books with a note sending the new reader
back to BookCrossing (think of wheresgeorge.com). Then you just
leave the book ""in the wild"" to be found by someone else; the
folks at BookCrossing suggest a park bench, the pocket of an
airplane seat, or just plain giving your book to a friend. ""Sounds
easy, right? Well it is. It's also a fascinating exercise in fate,
karma, or whatever you want to call the chain of events that can
occur between two or more lives and one piece of literature. Oh,
and we should mention, it's absolutely free and absolutely
private, too."" BookCrossing also offers book reviews, ratings, and
recommendations. Any modem that relies on Windows to function is dubbed a
""Winmodem."" Most manufacturers use ""Winmodems"" because they are
cheap and easy to set up on a standard model PC. I don't have any
problem with the manufacturer saving money (because living in a
capitalistic society, I would hope that the savings would trickle
down to ME in one way or another). I do, however, have a problem
with the way ""Winmodems"" function after you add more internal
devices to your PC. ""Winmodems"" rely on Windows to mediate their
serial communication (I/O address, COM port, IRQ, etc.) and as you
can imagine, the more devices Windows has to manage, the higher
the probability of running into a problem. And what if you want to
run Linux instead? Will the ""Winmodem"" function well, if at all,
in an operating system other than Windows? Don't bet on it! If you
want to make sure you don't have any problems after upgrading your
system, you'll want to get yourself a hardware modem. How can you
determine this? Checking a modem's system requirements. If the

Lockergnome Digital Media <subscriptions@lockergnome.com>,[Lockergnome Digital Media]  Humblest Alarm," 20020715 Lockergnome Digital Media http://www.lockergnome.com/ Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. http://www.gnomedex.comRegister for Gnomedex today! To all you Dream Theater fans out there, please accept my humblest of apologies. I mistakenly announced their break up in the last GnomeAudio section, causing quite a stir among a number of subscribers. In fact, they just released a double album this year and have been touring in support of that release. For today's false alarm, please make note of the tragedy that is the N'SYNC breakup (oh wait, that's just wishful thinking). I know I've already carried on about my Kyocera 6035 phone, but this thing is awesome. I've got all my contacts in one device. Web browsing is good - I'm sure it would be better on a color screen, like the http://www.handspring.com/products/treo270/index.jhtml?sub_nav_section=Overview&prod_cat_name=Treo270Treo 270, but for what I'll need, this works well. I'm currently looking for an ssh client I can install, so that remote server logins will be possible. My one complaint is the base station's use of a serial connector instead of USB, but I suppose they were cutting costs. I'm also scoping out the http://www.peanutpress.com/S=ed9724e6e001d4f7afd09fc34b785c41PTNCLsCoAAIAAGD6Ee43335503/makebook/index.cgi/pmlPalm Markup Language (PML) standard for marking up Palm Docs, in an effort to make the GnomeTomes a little flashier. I've installed several of the files on my phone and while they are easy to read, have all the content organized, and function as useful tips for the various subjects, I'd like to add some minor tweaks to future tomes, so that they look even better for me and anyone else who reads them on their Palm. TomeRaider v2.0 [1673k] W98/W2K/Pocket PC/Palm $25 http://www.tomeraider.com/http://www.tomeraider.com/ Of the formats Lockergnome uses for our GnomeTomes, TomeRaider is by far my favorite. Designed with a feel similar to CHM, the TR format is quite easy to read, as it places section titles in a pane separate from content, allowing you, the reader, to navigate through our tips (or anything else) with much greater ease than the linear format the other versions present. The Windows version of the software is truly designed with ease of use in mind. Creating ebooks for TomeRaider is a simple matter of combining a modified set of HTML tags with the designation for page breaks. The only trick for Yankees like me is remembering that center is tagged centre in the software.

In this segment, Triumph makes a mockery of geeks standing in line for Episode II. Whether you've been one of those geeks yourself, or you've never understood why anyone would dress up and wait in line for a movie, you'll still find this film amusing. 10 minutes was more than necessary to get the point across, yet Triumph delivers enough one-liners throughout to keep you watching all the way to the end.

Combined with some beautiful piano arrangements, Heleen's voice is a thing of beauty. A Netherlands native, who originally dreamed of saving the rainforests (at least according to her biography), her interpretation of American jazz standards and show tunes is more remarkable than most native English speaking vocalists. No world tour is currently scheduled, so you'll probably have to journey to Europe to see her in person, but for those of you living elsewhere in the world, the Internet makes a fabulous venue for experiencing Heleen van den Hombergh's talent.

List song names, time of day, playlist information, filenames, and a variety of other more obscure information. Changing caption colors is also doable within this plug-in. A set of hot keys makes controlling Winamp from your keyboard more functional, although you can't remap any of the keys. The Man Who Wasn't There (R) 2001 Drama - 116min Reviewer's Tilt (9) Much more film noir, than a movie trying to imitate film noir, The Man
Who Wasn't There captures the inevitable hopelessness of the genre. Ed
Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is the archetype everyman. A barber by trade,
Crane represents the individual in society. He hears everything, but
truly knows nothing. Everything he hears is modified ever so slightly by
the retelling. He gets neither the whole story nor the true motivations.
Left to guess at the motivations and desires of those around him, Crane
develops an indifference to it all. When a snake oil sales man slithers
into town, Crane takes this opportunity to cheat the cheaters and punish
the punishers. As indifferent as Crane appears, he is no match for the
amorality of fate. As much as fate is indifferent in its wrath, however,
so is it artistic in its execution. That is what makes our lives so
entertaining. Fate doles ultimate justice, but never as expected. The
Man Who Wasn't There is truly a Kafkaesque tale of an individual's year
to turn against the tide of inevitability. Atypical of cuter, more
recent Coen brothers fare, this film is reminiscent of their earlier
noir works like Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. Frances McDormand
does an outstanding job making as Crane's selfish wife and James
Gandolfini exudes boorishness as Doris' boss. The real outstanding
performances, however, rest with the supporting cast. Tony Shalhoub, as
pompus attorney Freddy Riedenschneider and Jon Polito as the snake oil
salesman impress and entertain as cruel, but offbeat parodies of their
characters. The black and white cinematography by Roger Deakins also
impresses and precisely underscores the bleakness of Crane's life and
the monochromatic nature of fate. Region 1 Encoding (US and Canada only)

I would like to use Windows Media >Player instead. --Wicked Based on your desription, we're guessing that QuickTime pops up when you try to stream a media file (video, audio, or MP3s) from the Web. If so, this probably means that you have QuickTime set as your default media player for all media files. And since your version of QuickTime is out-of-date, whenever it launches, it attmepts to upgrade. You could simply upgrade the program, or you can to turn off the autoupgrade feature. In QuickTime 5.0, open the program, select Edit > Preferences > QuickTime Preferences. Uncheck the box labeled ""Check for updates automatically."" If, however, you simply prefer to use Windows Media Player, open that program, click Tools > Options. Select the Formats tab, then check the boxes next to all of the file types that you want Windows Media Player to open. To make sure that QuickTime doesn't override your WMP settings, uncheck those file types within QuickTime.

at #5 on Amazon. If we ever
hit #1, I'll eat my hat. And, mind you, this hat has been sitting
around for quite a while; it smells like feet. You'd have to eat
three sombreros just to get the same amount of nutrition you'd get
from my hat. You're better off just going for the free stuff, I
suppose. The next time they ask: ""Do you care to Super Size that?""
You can respond, with dignity: ""My funds are sufficient for the
upgrade; I avoided spending money on something that would have
lasted longer, supported a helpful cause, and not have killed me
earlier."" It makes sense - if you think about it. The fries aren't
going to eat themselves. And if YOU don't eat the fries, who will? Put your hunger aside for just a moment. It's time for a paragraph
I like to call: ""Why you shouldn't sign up for DirectDSL."" They
went out of their way to send me an unsolicited e-mail this
evening. Now, I know what you're thinking: ""How kind of them,
Chris. You were just asking about DSL providers in yesterday's
issue. They must have read your mind!"" No, they must have rented a
list of addresses which weren't confirmed. But the fun didn't stop
there. I received a message about DirectTV from yet ANOTHER
marketing company. Their effort was indeed caught by this crafty
eye, and my money will be diverted to other (less-spammish)
businesses in the future. It's my ""direct"" way of saying: you're
not the only game in town. Anybody else care to test my patience?
I didn't think so. My blacklist gets shared with 250,000 people

junk; looks like Lycos will never get another click from me,
either. See what you get when you tempt fate? My good buddy, http://www.dnscentral.com/Bill,
tells me that http://www.speakeasy.net/refer/62026Speakeasy.net
provides great DSL connections. He'll even get the credit if I
sign up through his affiliate link! Paul Howes agrees with him,
too: ""Static IPs are the norm, they do not use PPPoE, and they
encourage people to run servers on their DSL connection. When
looking at their packages, I suggest you look at the 'Home
Services' page. They even have ADSL up to 1.5M downstream / 768k
upstream, which I have not seen from any other provider. And that
is less than $200 a month, which is a bargain when you start
looking at the prices of a 768k SDSL line!"" And Stuart Portner is
chock full of common sense: ""Remember that a lot of DSL providers
give you the modem for free and prefer that you use theirs - at
least for initial setup / shakedown period."" All the more fries

best thing to do with your money is to invest and then ""forget
about it."" Our Gnomie buddy Brian Stevens is the type of guy that
likes to play the stock market. He's always logging into E*TRADE
and checking on his stocks. That's a lot of work! We told him to
forget about it and let Company Overview do the work. This Excel
spreadsheet and add-in is a great way to check stocks and save the
data into a separate Excel spreadsheet. Brian says, ""E*TRADE
doesn't give me half the information that Company Overview does,
such as insider trades and financial trends, along with many other
tidbits of information."" NOTE: You must use Excel 2000 or higher
for the spreadsheet to operate correctly. Flexible Renamer v5.2.0 [426k] W9x/2k/XP FREE http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA014830/english/FlexRena/http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA014830/english/FlexRena/ {Rename your files} I work with a lot of files throughout the day,
and sometimes I end up with a desktop cluttered with useless
copies and shortcuts - and you KNOW how I feel about clutter. I
don't need a reminder that there are five shortcuts or six copies
of something on my desktop... and that is where Flexible Renamer
comes into the picture. With Flexible Renamer, I can cut off the
""Shortcut to"" and ""Copy of"" prefixes from all my files, making
them a lot easier to read. That's not all though... you can even
make a .txt file on your desktop into a .doc document in seconds.
If you don't like your filename in all caps, then just switch them
to lower case and vice-versa. The possibilities are endless! (You
know, I always wanted to change my own name from ""Chris"" to
""Caspian Wildflowers""...) http://www.infopackets.com/cgi-bin/click.cgi?id=83

realizing later that you actually needed it? Yeah, me too. Best-
case scenario, I would just go to the Recycle Bin and retrieve my
deleted file. But what if I had already emptied the Recycle Bin?
(Horrors!) Luckily, Disk Investigator can come into play and save
the day. (Yay!) With Disk Investigator, I can view deleted files
or directories, and restore them if necessary. I no longer have to
wonder if I fully deleted a troublesome file... I just load up
Disk Investigator, and I'll know if the file is gone (with 100%
certainty)! Actual Title Buttons 1.3 [1.0M] W9x/2k/XP $19.95 Unearthed by Michael Tretyakov http://www.actualtools.com/http://www.actualtools.com/ {Windows Explorer add-on} ""Actual Title Buttons lets you add the
new Minimize To Tray and Stay On Top buttons to any program's
title bar next to the Windows standard Minimize/Maximize/Close
buttons."" This program is a must for anyone who wants to avoid the
distractions of other windows popping up over your active windows.
While writing this review, I am using the ""Stay On Top"" command
for Notepad, and during this time I have already received five
instant messages. Why is this important? Normally these messages
would pop up in front of Notepad and disrupt my work... but with
Actual Title Buttons, I can keep typing without missing those
""important"" instant messages. The only difference is that they
aren't an annoyance now. The ""Minimize To Tray"" feature is great,
too, because freeing up taskbar space is a beautiful thing...

Electricon Land http://www.electriconland.com/http://www.electriconland.com/ {Icons for your machine} Gretchen and I are really looking forward
to moving to our new neighborhood in a little over a month.
Everything is better with a little dash of friendliness, right?
Icons are no exception. All the action on this website is based
around a city block of Electriconland. You walk into different
stores to get different pixel art icons. Walk into Gabu's Pub and
you will find icons in the likeness of Pink Floyd. You won't be
disappointed when you go around the corner and pick up your
Avengers icons from the comic store. If all this wasn't good
enough then maybe this fact alone will send you to the street of
Electriconland... all the icons are cross platform. This means you
can have your new favorite icons on your Windows, Mac, and Linux
machine, or maybe even a different one on each. The possibilities
are endless! I just hate it when I try to install a program and the
installation fails. I hate it even more when the program doesn't
leave a log file to help me track down the problem. Some would say
I am out of luck, but as long as the program uses Windows
Installer, then I am on Cloud Nine. Why am I so happy? Because for
any program that uses Windows Installer, I can turn on logging
through the Registry. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ Software \
Policies \ Microsoft \ Windows \ Installer. Add a new String
value, double-click it, and enter the following Value data:
""voicewarmup"" (sans quotes). These letters can be entered in any
order: v = Verbose output; o = Out- of-disk-space messages; i =
Status messages; c = Initial UI parameters; e = All error
messages; w = Non-fatal warnings; a = Start up of actions; r =
Action-specific records; m = Out-of- memory or fatal exit
information; u = User requests; p = Terminal properties. If you
add a plus, the existing file will be appended. If you add an
exclamation mark, each line is flushed. Now, when something fails,
I just have to check in the ""Temp"" directory and look for my log
files. They'll vary in name, but will always start with ""Msi"" and
end with the .LOG extension. As always, make sure to backup your

AnchorDesk <Online#3.20115.09-rB-TgEkNwY9w6RRR.1@newsletter.online.com>,Why we're changing our publishing schedule [ANCHORDESK]," ZDNet AnchorDesk Newsletter http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=1e-JQuLI4jWh9qqqwyqEsB8LE27qd4R"" > --> David Coursey --> Why we're changing our publishing schedule Dear Reader, As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every Friday Why are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines. I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired. Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you. Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down. For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works. I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=34-pJpSIcd8ldb3QT23_tvVyn4IcgyR"" >CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.

Dear Reader, Personal lasers come in shapes, sizes, and prices to suit almost any user. A low-end desktop laser printer can cost as little as $199 or as much as $500, but most hover around $300 and strike a good balance between speed, quality, and features. The less expensive models will suit students or home users who need to print letters or homework assignments, as well as perform other simple tasks. In pricier models, vendors typically add more RAM, higher-capacity paper trays, duplexing capabilities, and networking options for corporate and small-business users.

The upcoming version, the company's first major update of the product since releasing Exchange 2000 nearly two years ago, will by default disable certain messaging features to prevent hackers and virus makers from taking advantage of openings. While Microsoft's biggest nemesis in the e-mail and messaging market is Lotus, the company also competes against Novell and newcomer Oracle, which plans to release its own e-mail and messaging software later this year.

Big Blue has fixed many early Shark problems, improving everything from data transfer capabilities to cache size, and adding RAID 10 support and Eliza self-healing features. But IBM faces the still dominant EMC, which last week lured away Mark Lewis from HP to become its new CTO; and Hitachi, which still boasts the technology edge. IBM's edge is its ability to bundle Shark sales with related server and service deals.

Being that I have a print subscription to PocketPC Magazine, I haven't been by their website in quite some time, so when Hal Goldstein informed me of a new electronic delivery method that they've employed, I felt obligated to give it a spin. You can check out the September 2002 Issue of the I've also been using my PocketPC quite a bit lately, but not for data. It's found a more frequent home on my belt as an MP3 player ever since Diana's dad gave us a bicycle. Going out for a morning ride has been quite pleasurable, and it's nice to bring along some tunes. I've tried both the Compaq iPaq 3870 and HP Jornada 565, and have been more pleased with the audio ability of the iPaq, due in part to the sound utility Compaq provides to adjust treble and bass levels. It's just a more full-sounding device, in my opinion. LDAP Whodunit Pondered by Warren Dugas ""Randy, a little question for you: Do you know what LDAP is and how important it is to the world of technology? I'm sure you do - but where did it come from? Hmm, let's put our thinking caps on and try to figure it out. Did Microsoft create it? Hmm - No, how about Novell? Nope. Well, who then?"" History of LDAP http://www.microsoft.com/TechNet/prodtechnol/winntas/evaluate/featfunc/ldapcmr.asphttp://www.microsoft.com/TechNet/prodtechnol/winntas/evaluate/featfunc/ldapcmr.asp X.500, the OSI directory standard, defines a comprehensive Directory Service, including an information model, namespace, functional model, and authentication framework. X.500 also defines the Directory Access Protocol (DAP) used by clients to access the directory. DAP is a full OSI protocol that contains extensive functionality, much of which is not used by most applications. DAP is significantly more complicated than the more prevalent TCP/IP stack implementations and requires more code and computing horsepower to run. The size and complexity of DAP makes it difficult to run on thin clients, such as the PC and Macintosh where TCP/IP functionality often comes with the machine. DAP stack implementations are cumbersome to administer, thus limiting the acceptance of X.500. Hence in 1993, the folks at University of Michigan, with help from the ISODE Consortium, designed and developed a protocol that would work over TCP/IP and was small enough when implemented to run on a thin client like PC's running the Windows operating system or the Macintosh. The LDAP version 1 Specification was published in March of 1994. The LDAP version 2 Specification was published as rfc 1777 by the Access Searching and Indexing of Directories (ASID) working group in the IETF in March of 1995. In April of 1996, 40 companies including Microsoft, Netscape, and Novell separately announced support for LDAP protocol in their Directory Services products in order that they may in turn operate with each other and integrate with the Internet. LDAP version 3.0 has gone through several drafts but at this time is not finished. Looking for Sound Suggested by Corey Hollett http://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/santacruz/whatdoineed.asphttp://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/santacruz/whatdoineed.asp http://www.3dsoundsurge.com/reviews/earlyimpressions/ProMedia51.htmlhttp://www.3dsoundsurge.com/reviews/earlyimpressions/ProMedia51.html ""I've just gone on an extensive hunt for the best sound card and speaker set combination for 5.1 sound. My criteria were that it be excellent for games, music, and dvd playback. A price under $500.00 was also a strong point."" Corey came to the same conclusion that others have in two respects. Creative has long maintained a healthy share of the sound card market with a solid name and decent products. Audiophiles know of other brands as well, such as Turtle Beach and Philips, which also produce quality sound cards and at attractive price points. Corey decided on the Turtle Beach Santa Cruz card, a great choice. His choice of speaker systems reinforced my own feelings on the subject. I own two Klipsch speaker sets, the ProMedia 2.400 and most recently the ProMedia 5.1. The 2.400 system was the subject of many positive reviews, and believe me when I say that the ProMedia 5.1 leaves the 2.400 in the dust.

QuickTime 6 Released http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/ With the debut of QuickTime 6, we can assume that the licensing haggles over MPEG-4 have been resolved, making way for the long-awaited release. MPEG-4 isn't the only addition, joining a new AAC audio codec that is a favorite among professionals. Streaming media skip protection, Flash 5 support and better AppleScript functionality also tag along. As always, there is a standard free version available for download, but the Pro edition adds additional features, such as full screen video playback, the ability to create MPEG-4 content and editing features not present in the free player. Microtel & WalMart Love Linux http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26192.htmlhttp://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26192.html WalMart is selling Microtel PCs, but with a slight twist. They were one of the first manufacturers to preinstall LindowsOS and offer systems to the retail market through WalMart.com, and now Mandrake is being offered as a pre-
installed choice in operating systems. These options give potential Linux users an easier way to get started without having to build their own system from scratch or deal with driver issues, while still maintaining a low overall cost. A Pentium 4 2GHz system with a CD-RW drive goes for as little as $648 with Mandrake Linux, so not too shabby at all.

today! You're a good bunch, you Penguins. Today's GnomeVOICE really tells the story better than I can, but I'll give you a quick summary. Through your efforts and compassion, reader Karl Steenblik has found a new electronic home for the Foundation for Children and Youth With Diabetes. I'll let Karl tell you which offered solution suited his needs. But, with the volume of responses his request for help generated, it's almost irrelevant. As I expected, we came together as a community and collectively offered him many viable choices from which to pick a solution that would work for the kids. The global scope of your concern and our collective ability to effect a change has humbled me once again. Just when you start to get a little callous about the 'Net ... Accordingly, I'd like to sketch out an idea with you that can be an ongoing part of Penguin Shell. It's an open discussion, really, about how we can further put our technical skills (be they Linux or Windows skills) to work for a good cause. I'm proposing that we start an organized volunteer effort, based in the Penguin Shell readership, to provide volunteer technical services to worthwhile charitable organizations. First, we need a I'll start that ball rolling with a personal organizational suggestions - the That's just a suggestion. Feel free to use the mailto links above to make others. Over the next few weeks, I plan on modifying my current favorite blogging program, http://geeklog.sourceforge.net/"" target=""_blankGeekLog to pull together a community project area where interested parties can gather, coordinate and discuss whatever this project might become. I'll keep you posted on the details. In one of the earliest issues of Penguin Shell, I told a story about Emperor Penguins - how they huddle together on the shore, knowing that their protection from predators lies in sheer numbers. When one takes the leap into the water, all the others follow; individual involvement for the good of the community. Where could the analogy possibly be more fitting?

SPECIAL OFFER for Lockergnome readers, Quick Shortcuts Linux is chock full of keyboard shortcuts that, when used, streamline the way you use your system. Today's Tweaks are really user tweaks - built in shortcuts you can use to maximize your Linux efficiency. You don't have to change your system, just how you use what's already there. They're two tips that are quick and very easy to learn and remember. Got a cluttered console screen? Use [ctrl]+l to clear it. This does the same thing as the clear command with far fewer keystrokes. Do you want to log out of the console screen quickly? Use the [ctrl+d key combination. This will log out the current user. If you're using bash and the current user is not root, the [ctrl]+d combination will close the terminal window, as well. To me, any opportunity to save keystrokes is a good one. Better yet, if I can avoid having to take my fingers from the keyboard to reach for the mouse, then I've really saved some time. Though it's tough to quantify the time savings using these keystroke combination shortcuts, intuitively I can tell you it's substantial. Maximum efficiency. That's what Tweaks are all about. Kernel Configuration - Part XI We've covered some fairly light topics to this point in the kernel configuration series. Today's topic requires a bit of review. We'll discuss configuring block devices in your kernel. We've talked about the different types of devices in previous Penguin Shell issues. Fundamentally, the two that you'll deal with the most are block and character devices. These draw their type names from the way they handle data. Block devices receive data for storage in chunks, generally pre-set sizes of data ""blocks."" Hard drives are block devices. They'll only write chunks of data to storage. Thus, the problem with shutting down your machine uncleanly. Data intended for storage may not, in fact, have been written at the time your power dies or you hard kill your machine. The system may still be accumulating data up to the proper block size before committing it to the hard drive. Character devices, on the other hand, receive data in ""streams,"" one character at a time. Serial ports are a great example of character devices. They handle data input and output on the fly, rather than filling a buffer then committing the data. The physical nature of these device types goes a long way toward explaining why they handle data as they do. A hard drive has to physically spin up to store or retrieve data. You're actually changing the magnetic properties of the disc surface when you store data. Consequently, a hard drive has to know where there's free space on the disc surface, has to move that area of the disc under the write head and try, as best it can, to group blocks of related data together. Character devices really don't store data as much as they send it off and forget about it. The process is purely electrical rather than electrical and physical. The serial port, for example, sends data in a stream to your Palm Pilot. The storage of the data is actually handled by the Palm itself, not a physical storage device on the computer. There's no need to spin up a drive and account for the data as is necessary with a hard drive. The Palm will also send a signal back to the computer confirming receipt of data. That's an indication that character devices often communicate in both directions, as well. So, when you're configuring block devices in your kernel, you're preparing the system for communicating with a device that will buffer data to a predetermined level, then write that data as a block, changing the physical properties of the hard drive disc surface. Even though that's the highest level view of the process, it still shows how difficult a process physical data storage really is. In the block device section, you'll find many options for physical data storage. When configuring this section, it's crucial to know as much about your existing hardware as possible. What type (brand) of hard drives are you using? What's the interface to the machine - IDE, parallel, etc? Where is the drive located - on the local machine or on a network-connected box? Because the variables are so broad, it's nearly impossible to give you a stock configuration tip that will work for your personal machine every time. I can tell you this - you will have block devices (normally a hard drive and a floppy), and you need to answer as many of the above questions as you can. Find out as much about these physical devices as you can, and the configuration process will be relatively painless. A warning - you'll see more configuration tips like this as the series continues to progress. I'll certainly make hands-on configuration recommendations where possible. There are quite a few areas where I can make such recommendations. However, where the variable set is as broad as block devices, much of the legwork will be up to you. Tomorrow, we'll talk about RAID and multi-device support in Linux. rxLinux http://www.fusionw3.com/rxlinux/ http://www.fusionw3.com/rxlinux/ ""The concept behind rxlinux is to centralise configuration and management of multiple Linux servers. New servers can be deployed in minutes. A Web interface is used to build custom ISO CD-ROMs dedicated for specific servers. Servers, also called rxnodes, boot up from that CD-ROM and get the rest of the configuration and software from a master server. No administration is done directly on the nodes; everything is controlled from the master servers. When the rxnode has finished booting up and all software is running, it is completely independent from the rxmaster until the next reboot.""

He also notes Power Integrations is expanding its market with DC-to-DC power supply products, and says the firm's growth is based on converting today's power supplies to its more efficient technologies. As a result, the company doesn't need a boost in end-market demand to grow, Lee says. Although he sees a large, untapped market for Power Integrations and likes its long-term prospects, Lee suggests the stock is fairly valued. He believes shares of POWI are unlikely to rise much in the short term.

Lockergnome Windows Daily <subscriptions@lockergnome.com>,[Lockergnome Windows Daily]  Medieval Mocha," 20020717 Lockergnome Windows Daily http://www.lockergnome.com/ FREE COLOR PRINTERS FROM XEROX - $4,500 VALUE Enroll in the Xerox FreeColorPrinters program and get a Phaser network color printer for FREE. Small businesses, schools and non-profits have been participating in this risk free program since 1999. http://psstt.com/1/c/22869/64298/191532/191532Learn more. Falling asleep at the wheel is no laughing matter. Still, it kinda
happened with http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/daily/20020716.htmlyesterday's
tip. I forgot to mention that the String value's label
is ""Logging"" (sans quotes). That was almost like a cliffhanger,
eh? The oversight was totally my fault. I've been thinking about
asking Gretchen and Brian to help with future reviews. Don't be
surprised if that happens soon. I'm sure you'd welcome a female
perspective on this stuff, right? She helped one of our landlords
pick a paint color for the ""office"" wall this evening. Does that
qualify her to talk about cool stuff that we find for you on the
Internet? You betcha. Let's see how she does with the drapes and
rugs. I have a feeling I'll be the one tweaking furniture layout.
Shouldn't be too much of an issue - yet. I wonder if Ikea has an
affiliate program? I've mentioned how Yahoo Mail's beta is mangling our commas, but
did you know that it's also (possibly) rewriting your e-mail? If
you send an HTML message to someone who has a yahoo.com account,
something may get lost in the translation. Try sending this
sentence: ""My medieval mocha has an expression to evaluate.""
Again, be sure this note is sent in HTML format. The results will
surprise you. As far as I can tell, they're doing this to stop any
scripts from being distributed to their user base. I must credit
Marion Schroll for making me aware of the ""problem."" It's kinda
funny, in a weird sort of way. Not that I would want anything I
send changed in any way, shape, or form. It begs the question:
what next? I mean, where does it all stop? Give them a bit, and
they just might take a byte. Censorship is only a stone's throw
away. I really feel for Lockergnomie Sharon Clark, who asks: ""What is
this crazy business with the broadband metering? What they
advertise doesn't seem to be what you get. Now that I'm forking
out $60 per month for a supposed metered rate of 640 down / 320
up, I'm feeling clueless and left out in the cold. Not sure what
I'm paying for, not sure what's going on at the office, not sure
if I'm capped, not sure if I'm getting ripped off! Can you help me
out here? I'm feeling lied to; why can't I download 'til my 40 gig
is full? That is what they promised me and that is what I THOUGHT
I was paying for. I want consistent speed - is this too much to
ask?"" It's not too much to ask the question, but it's probably too
much to get the answer. I'm facing the same dilemma right now,
even though cable-based connectivity isn't available in my area.
Expect more and more ""filters"" to be put in place as time marches
on. Watch those EULAs, folks. Latest Downloads Directory Lister v0.5.2 [547k] W9x/2k/XP FREE http://freeware.prv.pl/http://freeware.prv.pl/ {List directory contents} When I was younger, I'd get so frustrated at those games where you'd have to pick out all of the subtle differences between two pictures. I'd always end up with one or two that I just could never see. When I want to do the same type of comparison between two directories on my computer, I use Directory Lister and I never miss a thing. Not only does Directory Lister display the contents of your chosen directories, it will also let you save the output to an HTML file. This is great for web developers who want a quick way to list the contents of a ZIP file before archiving it and uploading it to their website. As an added bonus, Directory Lister also shows the date, time, and attributes of the files in your directory, making it easier than ever to compare the differences in files between two directories. Web Calendar [25k] W2k/XP FREE http://members.lycos.co.uk/bleucanard/WebCalendar.htmhttp://members.lycos.co.uk/bleucanard/WebCalendar.htm {Web page reminder} Surfing the web as much as I do, I'll occasionally run into a site or page that commits the horrendous faux pas of displaying an ""Under Construction"" banner. I COULD forget about the site and maybe somehow encounter it later, or I COULD drop the site into Web Calendar and have this handy-dandy app remind me to check the page again in a week. The same technique holds true for my normal browsing... for example, I can use Web Calendar to remind me to check out the Digital Media newsletter every morning, or to check Amazon for a CD that I know will be released in a week. Now, I will have no excuse for missing the DVD release of ""Lord of the Rings""... http://www.infopackets.com/cgi-bin/click.cgi?id=83

User(s) may double-click on data sources to access the databases, browse tables, execute custom queries and export (the) data to .CSV or .XML files.""

CollegeBAR v8.0 [5.9M] W9x/2k/XP US$20 Unearthed by Shawn Verrall http://www.pracx.com/collegebar.asphttp://www.pracx.com/collegebar.asp {Mix your own drinks} When I was in college, my room used to be known as ""The Bar."" It may have had something do with my L-shaped desk that resembled a bar, and the fact that I had seen the movie Cocktail too many times and wanted to be a bottle-flipping bartender. I never achieved my goal of being the world's best geek bartender, but maybe with College Bar I could have. College Bar contains recipes for over 11,600 drinks. With an online update feature, you can download new drinks as they become available... or you can add your own creative concoctions to the database! College Bar also has a calculator to determine someone's blood alcohol level... drink responsibly, folks. As an added bonus, you can load some of your favorite party pictures into the program and you'll see a slide show of those pictures - a great way to remember the good times... unless you don't remember experiencing them in the first place, that is.

I am a sucker for keyboard shortcuts. Anything that can save me from using the mouse is good in my book. Occasionally I like to view the web or Windows Explorer in Full Screen mode... to do this I just hit F11 on the keyboard and there I am in Full Screen mode. Hit it again and I am back to regular mode. If you aren't as much of a fan of keyboard shortcuts as me, then all you have to do is press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Maximize button and you will have the same effect. You will notice, however, that your Start Menu isn't anywhere to be seen. Never fear, another keyboard shortcut is here... just press Ctrl key plus the Esc key and your Start Menu will be back where it belongs. Alternatively, if you have a Windows key on your keyboard you can use that key to bring up your Start Menu as well.

Lockergnome Apple Core <subscriptions@lockergnome.com>,[Lockergnome Apple Core]  Intuitive Cash," 20020716 Lockergnome Apple Core http://www.lockergnome.com/ Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. http://www.gnomedex.comRegister for Gnomedex today! Of the comments I received on AppleScript, every single one suggested I start with the basics, for that reason, I'm going to take things step-by-step, following my own learning process and progressing to gradually more difficult concepts. Despite having experience in programming, using a variety of languages, I initially found AppleScript to be quite intimidating -- mostly because something about the Script Editor seems less than intuitive. If you've already been dabbling in scripting, the first few columns on the subject will definitely be targeted at novices, but I want to everyone to have the chance to get up to speed. I'm off to the http://www.sic.orgShareware Industry Conference for the remainder of the week, where it's looking like the selection of stuff for Mac users will be very bleak. I believe the organization is targeted more toward the Windows community in general and any shareware developer with enough cash to get there is probably going to be in New York for MacWorld. I'll be missing out on the Web cast of Steve Jobs speech, which is scheduled to take place while I'm in the car, but at least I'll be able to catch the details at other Mac sites when I get to St. Louis. Internet access for the trip is being provided by Crosspaths.net, which is one of the few dialup services I've found that can be configured to relay my Lockergnome mail so that I can still function on the road. I tested the service on my iBook this evening just to be sure. With some luck, I may be able to get Internet access from the highway, via my Kyocera 6035, and see what Jobs had to say before I get to St. Louis. Unfortunately, there's no support for OS X yet with the 6035, so I can't use the unlimited nights and weekends to dial the Web from my laptop. A landline will probably be more sensible anyway. Check my blog for some updates on the trip, Lori's attending too and I'm sure she'll be taking lots of photos, as usual. Same-X v2.0 [1.73MB] OSX 10.1.1 FREE http://www.thumpbunny.com/http://www.thumpbunny.com/ Seven themes, two board sizes and your choice of difficulty levels, makes this a game for the entertainment addict in all of us. The object is to clear the board of all icons, removing them in matching clusters of two or greater at a time. Clearing the screen awards bonus points and scoring awards clearing of larger clusters. Nothing gets killed, there's no swearing, but you'll find yourself addicted to the mindless fun anyway -- not to mention you can feel safe sharing this with kids. Samba Sharing Package v1.5 [8.3MB] OS X FREE http://xamba.sourceforge.net/ssp/http://xamba.sourceforge.net/ssp/ It remains to be seen whether 10.2 will render this type of application unnecessary, but for those out there without the cash to spend on DAVE, for small office or home networking of Mac/PC mixed environments, this is the only real alternative. Installation and configuration is almost painless, making it easy for your Windows machine to see apps on your Mac with little difficulty. The interface, like most OS X GUI apps, is quite easy to navigate, including user management, connection management, and share configuration into a convenient Prefernce pane. Technically speaking, you could do most of your script writing in a text editing application like TextEdit, but ultimately you've got to compile it in the Script Editor, so you might as well start there. The Script Editor is located in the AppleScript subfolder of your Applications folder. Opening the application for the first time reveals a small window divided in to two sections, Description and the actual scripting pane, separated by a group of buttons. Ignore the buttons for the moment and concentrate on the two text panes. The Description pane is where you label your script, so you can remember later what it does. This is also the place you denote the key combination that will invoke your script. If you choose to save your script as an executable application, the information in the description will show up in the start up screen. The second pane is where the magic happens. In this pane you will be telling applications to do specific tasks when your script runs. The format for scripting is fairly linear. You either start your script at the top most level drilling down, until you actually reach the application or object you want to manipulate with your script, or you take the reverse approach manipulating things from the bottom up. Telling the ""Applications"" folder to tell its ""Jake"" subfolder to tell the application ""Jake's Media Player,"" located in that folder to do something could also be written by telling the script to access ""Jake's Media Player"" located in the ""Jake"" subfolder of the ""Applications folder, The upcoming example will make this a bit more clear.

Glitschka.com http://www.glitschka.comhttp://www.glitschka.com Flash animations, downloadable icons, artistic doodles, and details about the artist himself are available from this site. You're guaranteed to find something entertaining here, and if you need a logo designed, Von Robert Glitschka might even take you on as a client. The portfolio is extensive, including stock images and even some icons by the artist's seven year old daughter. A must read is the anatomy of an illustration section, which lays down artistic opinion, straight from Glitschka's mouth on how to make a funny creation. This is by no means a Mac only site, the entertainment is accessible by everyone and icons are available in both Mac and PC versions. Traditionally, Mac OS has always placed a link to various disks in use on the desktop, which can be convenient, but is no longer necessary with the Finder only a Command+Tab away in the Dock. My personal desktop is usually cluttered with files I've downloaded from the Internet, so I can never find anything when my desktop is in plain sight, the Finder is the only way I stay organized. For desktop slobs like me, or for neat freaks who want nothing on the desktop, OS X includes three handy options for keeping disks in their place. Open the Finder Preferences window and uncheck the three checkboxes under Show these items on the Desktop. You'll have more space for other icons to clutter the desktop or in the case of you clean folk, you'll have nothing at all.

When MusicNet and Pressplay launched their monthly subscription services late last year, I was unimpressed. Their music catalogs were limited, the software was clunky, and the copyright protection features seemed unduly restrictive. I wondered how they could ever compete with the seductive (read: free) charms of file sharing. But last week I decided to try out Listen.com&#146;s http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=ea-fjLyQhV4XV2SrBzAwQ4lAUw-5WnR"" >Rhapsody, a subscription streaming music service that recently managed to secure recordings from all five major labels. And now I&#146;m rethinking my stance. Rhapsody is not for everyone. If you like to burn your MP3s to CD or download them to a portable player, you&#146;ll want to look elsewhere; Rhapsody allows CD burning only for a small portion of its catalog, and only for an extra charge, and you can&#146;t download MP3s at all. But what Rhapsody does have is music, and lots of it--thousands of albums of all major genres on demand as well as tons of preprogrammed radio stations. I think Listen.com might be onto something with its streaming service. Would you pay 10 bucks a month for a service that has all the music you could ask for, but won't allow you to actually download MP3s?

Here are some representative responses from last week's question on who should take the blame for Web sites not being compatible in every browser: ""Web builders should be doing as much as possible to support the broadest possible usage by their target audience""
A little over half the responses put the onus of compatibility on builders. ""There are far less browser makers than there are Web builders and users. So it doesn't make sense for users or Web builders to do that job does it?.""
After Web builders, browser manufacturers got the most blame, although this response makes the best argument. ""The ordinary users are one group most at fault since they tend to stick to only one browser.""
Few responses said users should take responsibility, as most respondents fall into the Web user category. ""As a professional designer, I say proprietary code is downright evil, no matter who it comes from--and no matter what nifty trick it does.""
Quite a number of Web builders wrote in, with many taking responsibility while noting the difficulty of testing in every browser. ""Because Web pages are viewed 90 percent of the time by IE it is understandable that the time spent to make a site compatible with the remaining tiny minority has to be justified.""
A few responses quoted server logs, making the point that it's not cost efficient to make sites compatible for people who choose a low-market share browser. http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=8e-VezcrMnFnTUQdia0kcLEkaU3EijOqdRRUnsubscribe | Manage My Subscriptions | Advertise |

Read the full story Server consolidation eases system management Software contracts: Clause for alarm In the high-stakes game of corporate software negotiations, the silver-tongued sales rep isn't your biggest challenge: It's the language in the contracts. Enterprise customers spend surprisingly little time pouring over the fine print of multi-million dollar software contracts that are rife with obscure terminology, vague expansion charges, and mind-boggling license conversions. As a result, they end up paying in ways they had never imagined long after the deal is signed. Just ask California. Read the fine print Six steps to the best TCO with Linux Don't just bring in Linux as yet another OS to manage. To help you determine whether Linux offers better TCO than Windows, Gartner examines the benefits and pitfalls of deploying Linux-based servers.

The town of Brooklyn, Iowa has a bridge that they are Ever since I was down toward Des Moines last week and had a cup-o-java with Jake at Starbucks, I've been craving coffee. I can't see myself turning into a coffee junkie like Chris, but it's just weird that this would happen, being that my extent of coffee drinking has usually been limited to the severe need for a quick morning wake-up or in an effort to keep warm on cold mornings when out in the field back in my Marine Corps days. As time has gone on, I've been trying to cut back on the typical geek vices of sugar and caffeine, but I can't drink coffee straight. It has to be sweet, and what's the point of drinking coffee if there's no caffeine? Enter Splenda. An artificial sweetener that has finally made it to Waterloo, Iowa. Most of what Diana and I use sugar for has been modified to use Splenda instead, with good results. Hopefully this coffee thing is just a temporary kick like it usually is. I have to brush my teeth after a cup or two from the nasty breath. It's fun to test out the dragon-breath on the cat to see just how bad it really is. If Bootes sniffs a couple of times, it's not too bad, but if she instantly recoils, time to employ the Sonicare for a couple of minutes. See what you've started, Jake? Exchange Titanium Details Emerge http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/jul02/07-15exchangeqa.asphttp://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/jul02/07-15exchangeqa.asp Oracle recently announced their intention to compete directly with Microsoft Exchange, even accepting Outlook as an email client. In what seems like a direct response, we're handed details of the 2003 release of Exchange Titanium. I've always liked what Exchange can do, so I'm certainly looking forward to seeing what the new features will be all about, but I'm also interested in what Oracle will be bringing to the table. Better email functionality, control and security are the name of the game, whoever ends up being the vendor of choice. Included in this Q&A is a screenshot of what Outlook may look like once Office 11 is released. It's an interesting concept shot, showing some new ways they plan to handle email views. It doesn't say anything for Exchange functionality, but it's worth noting regardless. Better Pocket PC Audio Unearthed by David Spencer http://home.adelphia.net/~mdukette/downloads.htmlhttp://home.adelphia.net/~mdukette/downloads.html An open source project is bringing a different spin to audio and video on Pocket PCs, and my first impression is... cool! I like what they're working on here. I decided to wipe out my Jornada yesterday, so I haven't done a direct comparison between the iPaq 3870 and Jornada 565 for audio quality using this player, which has an equalizer built-in, but it definitely has potential judging from how it sounds on the iPaq right out of the gate. Definitely give this a peek if you're one of those that likes to play audio and video on a Pocket PC. Quite a few different versions are supported, so you should be able to find something appropriate to your device.

Where's Java? http://news.com.com/2100-1001-944053.htmlhttp://news.com.com/2100-1001-944053.html Three readers asked me about this very thing this week, and it's something you should probably know about if you use Windows XP. Microsoft didn't bundle the Java Virtual Machine with Windows XP, and since the release of XP, the JVM has been avaialble via the Windows Update site as a ""convenience"" to users. Part of Sun's legal
complaints surrounding how Microsoft has handled Java was that Microsoft did not have the right to distribute their implementation via the web, though they did have licensing rights to include it with Windows. So essentially, Microsoft has things backwards, as it seems. Well, to avoid further web distribution arguments, Microsoft has yanked the JVM from the Windows Update site and all other areas of Microsoft's web site. Microsoft is still planning to include Java with Windows XP Service Pack 1. You'll have to plan for Java support accordingly, as SP1 is still a ways off and you can't get it from Microsoft at this point. If you need it for a new installation of Windows XP in the short term, Sun will gladly provide you with http://java.sun.com/getjava/download.htmltheir own distibution. Another Xeon Deal Served up by Warren Dugas http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?sku=C170-1032%20Phttp://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?sku=C170-1032%20P I mentioned a really nice deal on Compaq Evo W6000 dual-
Xeon workstations a few weeks back, which I know several of you took advantage of, but the $1999 price tag likely scared off many others. If you still want to get into a Xeon, check this one out. TigerDirect is offering an Evo W8000 workstation with a single 1.7GHz processor, 18.2GB 15,000rpm U160 drive, 48x CD-ROM and licenses for both Windows 2000 Pro and NT 4.0 Workstation for $699.99. Note that there is NO memory and no video card included, so you'll have to scrounge those for yourself, but it really is a pretty good deal, on the whole. Also realize that these systems take RAMBUS memory, which will add a bit of cost, so be sure you know what you're getting - a wicked-fast workstation, to be sure! Expandability is also quite amazing with these machines.

Motorola, a day after posting the largest quarterly loss in its history, said it expects to achieve earnings of about 2 cents a share in the third quarter and 10 cents in the fourth quarter. The estimated earnings for the second half of the year includes charges of about $215 million related to previously announced restructuring actions. The world's second largest mobile phone maker has slashed its work force by more than a third from its peak of 150,000 in August 2000.

there's Chilkat, a cool zip/unzip ActiveX control that you can
add to any language with ActiveX support (which is most major
ones). But my personal favorite is VB-PowerWrap, a simple tool
that takes all the far-flung bits and pieces of your Visual Basic
masterpiece and socks them all away into one executable file

Create and decompress zip archives with the Chilkat Zip ActiveX control. The control provides easy access to individual files stored within a zip archive. You can search for a file within the zip using a wildcard string and then extract individual files or files matching a pattern. Files can be unzipped to any directory, and the control's memory management allows any size file to be compressed or decompressed in a constant memory footprint. The control allows you to compress directly from memory buffers or strings, as well as add multiple files with wildcarding. There's even a real-time progress monitor for zip and unzip operations. Chilkat supports Active Server Pages, Visual Basic, Visual C++, Delphi, C++ Builder, and all languages that use ActiveX controls. in Java http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=97-dlfYQ1M1B4XYK9w3V0z6qjySJGeR"" >Anfy Java 2.0 Anfy is a collection of 52 applets for Web pages, desktop wallpapers, or screensavers.

Whether you've been using it for a while or are planning to upgrade to the new OS soon, this ebook is right up your alley. http://store.eSellerate.net/s.asp?s=STR550611850&Cmd=BUY&SKURefnum=SKU3000768669&AFFIDC=AFF669529939GET YOUR COPY of Lockergnome's Top 50 Windows XP tips now! This is of course belated, as I'm sending it on the 18th, but Happy Birthday to Lori! One thing about MacWorld should excite mp3 junkies -- the iPod just got even bigger, with a 20GB version and Apple officially endorses Windows compatibility. Actually, the good news is, the 5GB and 10GB versions came down in price. Hearing that the only ""officially"" functional Windows player is MusicMatch Jukebox Plus is a serious downer, in my opinion. Sure, MusicMatch is a decent player, but with plenty of great free players on the market, why do we want to purchase a software player in addition to the $299+ hardware unit? At first glance, it looks like Apple is only paying lipservice to true Windows compatibility. I've seen no mention of any additional functionality, besides song management via one media playing utility. Mediafour's http://www.mediafour.com/products/xplay/XPlay remains a better option, in my opinion. In addition to allowing you to use an iPod with almost any media player made for Windows, it assists with contact management, via Outlook vCards, in addition to making the iPod an additional drive on your PC. At a mere $10 more than MusicMatch Jukebox Plus, XPlay blows the doors off Apple's officially endorsed player.

Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (NR) 1966 Adapted Play - 131min Reviewer's Tilt (10) Before directing Catch-22 and The Graduate, Mike Nichols made his big screen debut directing this adroit adaptation of Edward Albee's play ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" Nominated for thirteen, and winner of five, Academy Awards, this dark tale centers on history professor George (Richard Burton), and his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), daughter of the college president. At first George and Martha appear to be the average Ozzie and Harriet, an aging, well-adjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love. George and Martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty cocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs. Just as quickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology professor Nick (George Segal) and his shy, but pretty wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) stop by for a nightcap. Unfortunately for Nick and Honey, the sardonic exchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise. Soon Nick and Honey find themselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sick-witted exchange. Throughout the remainder of the movie, George and Martha dance their finely choreographed, oft-rehearsed dance of despise. The two alternate the lead, alternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step. Thankfully, writer Albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost unadulterated. Taylor and Burton deliver his lines with great force and impeccable timing. At one point George proposes ""Now that we're through with Humiliate the Host...and we don't want to play Hump the Hostess yet...how about a little round of Get the Guests?"" This provides some idea of the precarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to finish. Albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is Taylor and Burton's alchemy, converting Albee's words into cinematic gold. Ok, I will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not have been much of a stretch. Both actors, however, deliver their lines with the chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying slaying. Often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax or look away. Simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is not a ""feel good"" movie. ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is, however, a memorable film that will stick with you for years to come. Region 1 Encoding (US and Canada only)

The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every Friday Why are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines. I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired. Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you. Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down. For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works. I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=00-4FQlI9QDB2t8PBibgi4cHr7W6TiR"" >CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.

Setting the Home Page in Konqueror Konqueror, while a great browser, has taken a step in the direction of IE. Like IE, Konqueror is really an integrated web and file browser. You can use it equally well to view web pages and files on your system. It's been something of a hot debate whether this is actually the proper use of a browser. In fact, Galeon was written specifically to answer this question - it's a web browser and a web broswer only. Regardless, it can be a bit annoying to punch the Home button on the Konqueror browser and end up in your /home/user directory. Have no fear, though. It's an easy change to make your actual web home page the home page in Konqueror. Open Konqueror and select Settings from the toolbar. Select ""Configure Konqueror,"" and leave the default selection of ""File Manager"" as is. In the text box on the right half of the screen, you'll see a tilde in the ""Home URL"" text box. That just tells Konqueror to use the user's home directory as the home URL. Changing this to a web address will set that address as your home page. Select OK to close the window. Taking it one step further, click on the Home button in your Konqueror browser to open your newly-configured web home page. Then, select ""Window"" and ""Save View Profile, 'Web Browsing.'"" This will futher save the URL and allow your the opportunity to save the window size when the browser opens. Konqueror is more than just a web browser. But, it's not so tough to make it act like a pure web browser if you just know where to look. Kernel Configuration - Part XII Depending on who you talk to, RAID can stand for ""Redundant Array of Independent Discs"" or ""Redundant Array of Inexpensive Discs."" No matter. They both point to the same theory and practice in Linux; data storage redundancy. That's today's kernel configuration section - Multi-Device Support. Let's talk first about the principles behind a RAID setup. RAID uses multiple discs for speed, increased data storage, or data redundancy. Fundamentally, there are 5 levels of RAID in Linux; Linear, RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-4, and RAID-5. Linear RAID uses two or more discs, appending data from one to another. In other words, when disc 1 is full, disc 2 steps in to store data. There is no redundancy in Linear RAID - only an increase in storage capacity. Further, there's no marked increase in data access speed because you're accessing one drive in the RAID array at a time. RAID-0 ""stripes"" data across the RAID drives. Some data will be written to the first drive, some to the second, etc. Like Linear RAID, RAID-0 provides no redundancy. Because the data has been written in parallel across the drives, not all data exists on all drives. Lose a drive and your data is gone. RAID-0 will, however, decrease data access time. Your system will run more quickly. RAID-1, unlike Linear and RAID-0, does provide data redundancy. This is the first level in which data is ""mirrored"" across the drives in the RAID array. All data that exists on one drive exists on all the others. RAID-1 requires at least two drives and they should be of equal size, otherwise, your overall RAID array will be the size of the smallest drive. Performance with RAID-1 can actually be slower than with a single drive or RAID-0, as all the data is written across multiple discs. RAID-4 is, for the most part, pretty useless. It reserves one disc for http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=parity"" target=""_blankparity information while striping the data across the others. This is much like Linear mode, with an additional disc thrown in for parity data. Parity data can be used to reconstruct and retrieve the data on the other drives, but this really isn't a redundant method of data storage. Consequently, RAID-4 is probably the least used of the RAID schemes. RAID-5 is designed for 3 or more discs and provides both redundancy and speed. Like RAID-4, RAID-5 pays close attention to parity data. However, rather than reserving a device in the RAID array for this data, it's written across the array. Because the parity data is written across the array, data recovery can be accomplished fairly quickly. In fact, using a ""spare disc"" configuration will allow RAID-5 to reconstruct the data to the spare disc immediately after the failure of a drive. Because of it's increased speed and redundancy, RAID-5 is probably the most common setup for multiple storage devices. With all that in mind, you'll need to make a choice in your kernel configuration. Do you have mutliple drives of the same size that you'd like to configure as a RAID array? The Multi-Device Support section of the kernel configuration will allow you to do this. In fact, you'll be able to set the RAID level, as well. Again, evaluate your needs and select the appropriate option. Tomorrow, it's on to networking options in your kernel configuration.

previously-unavailable tracks. If you aren't sure about purchasing
it outright, I strongly urge you to sign up for a trial Does anybody know how to set a binary clock? Melanie got it for me
as a gift (which was a very nice gesture). Sure, I could read the
manual - but the ones and zeros start to look eerily similar after
flipping past the first page. You know me: I'm not much of a math
guy. In fact, I just discovered the other day that 'byte' was
short for 'by eight' (even though I already knew that 'bit'
represented 'binary digit'). I'd stick with a digital timepiece,
but it just isn't geeky enough for me anymore. How sad is that?

Latest Downloads GigAlarm v1.201 [33k] W9x/2k/XP FREE http://users.bigpond.net.au/glina/GigAlarm.htmhttp://users.bigpond.net.au/glina/GigAlarm.htm {String on your finger} Sometimes, I'm a bit like the absent-minded professor... I would forget my own head if it wasn't attached. So naturally, I appreciate any program that can help keep me on track, and with GigAlarm I can setup whatever reminders/alarms I need. However, sometimes a simple text message just won't catch my attention. Well, herein lies the beauty of GigAlarm... it doesn't just have to give you a text alarm! GigAlarm can play a WAV file (random, or your selection), change your background, start a program, or use one of the many Windows shutdown options. My wife has gotten in the habit of using the Shutdown option as an alarm to signal that I have spent too long on the computer. (Lucky for me, there is a snooze button!) NOTE: The author says, ""This program is essentially free to use for non-profit purposes... If you find this program useful I would appreciate $10 AUD (or $5 USD) as a token of your appreciation.""

Double-clicking on an image and waiting for it to come up in my image viewer is almost too much for me to handle. Lucky for me, Context Thumbview has made its way onto my system and I no longer have to wait to view an image. All I do now is right-click the image, choose ""View Thumbnail,"" and there is the image, out there for me to see... all without me having to open up any programs! ""As Express ThumbView is an Explorer extension, it is always ready and available for use. Moreover, it is available in any Explorer window, including Open and Save As... dialog boxes."" As an added bonus, with Context Thumbview installed on my system, I can also turn off the thumbnail view if I want to save system resources. http://www.infopackets.com/cgi-bin/click.cgi?id=83

I don't think so! Starter isn't JUST another Startup Manager, it's a piece of programming art. One of my biggest problems with Windows Task Manager is that I don't know what all the processes on my machine are, or from where they are running. Starter not only gives me that information, but it also lets me save it as an HTML file. In addition, Starter lets me import and export registry keys or add a new task to be processed. Don't run all over your machine trying to find all the programs you need to control your PC, when you can do it all (and more!) with Starter.

I use to have these notes all over my monitor. Now my screen is clean as a whistle! Aversoft Sticker is a program to help you remember ""important information by displaying skinnable sticky notes on your Windows desktop."" No more bland notes for me! With Sticker, I am surrounded with pictures of paradise (downloaded from Aversoft's website). These great features are no accident. Sticker also has a transparency feature that makes the notes only half visible, making it much easier to use while working on your other programs. Don't walk away yet though... Sticker also allows you to print your notes, lock them from accidentally being deleted, and set an alarm (repeating or one-time). Speaking of alarms, mine just went off and opened up Outlook.

Wikipedia is a free, and very thorough online encyclopedia; you'll be hard-pressed to stump this information tool with an undocumented topic. Know what you're looking for? Then just use the search tool. In the mood to fill your cranium with a few new thought processes? Just browse through any one of Wikipedia's many categories until you find a subject that piques your interest. From Physics to Opera; from Anthropology to Cooking, you will find it all here. Now, all that is missing is you! Take a look and beef up your gray matter. Gnomies are known for their willingness to help others and Alex Warren is no exception with a tip on copying text. Alex writes: ""Did you know that you can copy the contents of a message/dialog box just by pressing Ctrl+C?"" Alex also had this to say: ""When you select text and then use the mouse to drag it to a new location, the original text moves to the new location and disappears from the old location. However, you can select text and then use the right mouse button to drag it to a new location. When you do this, releasing the right mouse button opens a menu from which you can choose to move or copy the text (along with several other options)."" Those are some great time saving tips Alex! Following suit with using Ctrl + C to copy... you can also use Ctrl + X to cut and Ctrl + V to paste. You can also use all these tips on more then just text! The next time you need to copy some files on your PC, try the right-click and drag method and you will see what I mean... along with saving yourself some time.

I borrowed a data vac from a friend and decided to clean all of the dust and cat hair from my systems, then after reconnecting everything, the server would boot to the initial splash screen, where there is a POST progress bar, but would not proceed past past about the first 1/5th of the bar. Uh-oh. What did I fry? As it turns out, it was another case of ""always check the small stuff"". Oh, I had all of the cables plugged back in to the server properly, I checked all of that, but it didn't dawn on me until about a half dozen boot attempts later that I should probably turn an eye toward the other end of the cables. That server is connected to an 8-port Compaq KVM switch and with all of the yanking, plucking and shuffling, the keyboard cable had been eeked out of the switch just a tad. Why the server didn't display a keyboard warning message like every other computer on the planet, I can only attribute to the BIOS developers. Server Satchel, running Red Hat Linux 7.2 is now operating as it was previously. The penguin is happy. The server case is even black. How appropriate... Windows XP Security Checklist Finely crafted by Bernie Klinder http://www.labmice.net/articles/winxpsecuritychecklist.htmhttp://www.labmice.net/articles/winxpsecuritychecklist.htm With all of the security features crammed into Windows XP, where does one start? Do you need VPN capability? Is NTFS an appropriate file system choice for you? Is there any value at all in Simple File Sharing? After much hounding, Bernie Klinder has drawn up a healthy checklist of things you need to address under Windows XP in order to maintain a system that is both security and compatible with the rest of your computing world. ATI Still Makes Video Cards? http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1656http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1656 Say it isn't so! Yes, apparently they do still have something to say about NVIDIA's dominance in the video card market. Seeing as how they've been all but dumped by the majority of top-tier system makers, it's hard to believe that they are capable of a serious comeback. Judging from what AnandTech has to say about the forthcoming R300-based cards, it appears that they haven't thrown in the towel just yet. I'm all for competition, so I welcome the effective re-
entrance into the high end market. Let's all hope that their driver development has improved as much as their hardware seems to have.

I liked that cup of Mocha (spelled M-O-C-H-A and I'll explain in a minute) I drank at Starbucks when Jake and I visited last week, but if I wanted to relay that to someone using a Yahoo email account, you might see an alternate word. Thus the additional hyphenated spelling just in case those of you using Yahoo to subscribe to Lockergnome actually received your issues and the word has been altered to suit their personal opinion of my choice in drinks. They've also had a terrible time interpretting our W3C standardized HTML lately, dropping in copious #message references throughout the text in their new Beta email client. So why the text replacement? It's another filtering technique to stop certain words that might relate to JavaScript functions. I guess I'll have to choose another beverage next time. Silly me. Yer Kidding... Really? http://www.theregus.com/content/4/25629.htmlhttp://www.theregus.com/content/4/25629.html I'm all sorts of sarcastic today, aren't I? Those of us that have had to manage budgets are used to dealing with math in terms of hardware, software, maintenance and personnel costs. It's not really that difficult. It's certainly not hard to see that dropping a free version of Linux on a server with less hardware requirements just to do some file sharing, printing and maybe an Intranet page or three is far cheaper than using Windows. At very long last, Microsoft has admitted as much. Of course, they're quick to point out that they have much more to offer than Linux, which may indeed be true. But at the end of the day, when you compare donuts to donuts and like functions against one another, Linux is cheaper. For a shop of Windows-trained staff, dealing with Linux will certainly be a challenge, requiring additional training, suffer the odd blunder here and there, and be less forgiving when it comes to detailed configuration. On the same token, make a Linux whiz use Windows and see how quickly you'll be searching for a replacement. Cheap is in the budget of the beholder.

If the nation's politicians expect Silicon Valley to fall in line on the issue of expensing stock options, they're living in a fantasy world. Flipping through my Rolodex this past week, I couldn't find one solitary technology type willing to support even the mildest proposal to change how corporations account for stock options. The more common response was a verbal ""middle finger"" shouted in the general direction of Washington. No surprises, there. The options argument is not just about putting food on the table--make that a lot of food, in some cases--but about the way the computer industry views itself. Tech companies believe they belong in a different category, say, from the likes of Coca Cola, Washington Post Co. and Bank One Corp.--all which recently decided to begin expensing stock options. Tech titans also served notice they will remember to support friends--and shun foes--in Washington next November. An empty threat? Perhaps, but consider this: in the last national election, the computer industry contributed more than $40 million (52 percent to Democrats, 46 percent to Republicans.)

SPECIAL OFFER for Lockergnome readers, Checking Mail With KMail I've recently become a KDE convert - impressed enough with KDE-3 to move me from my longtime desktop friend Gnome. While I use a combination of fetchmail, procmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong contender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the KDE desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use. There's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't automatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much time as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the additional step to check your email after opening the program would be an irritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and simple configuration issue. To force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon in your KDE panel. Select ""Preferences"" and the ""Execute"" tab. In the Execute window, change the command line to read: kmail --check -caption ""%c"" %i %m The addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail when you open the program. Fewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right? Kernel Configuration - Part XIII As you well know, Linux is simply the most robust operating system for networking around. With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed to stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It should come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux kernel configuration is dense with details and options. I will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections of the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock configuration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas. You're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be used and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and external). Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options. For security issues, I can recommend several good articles and HowTos: http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/tutorials/211/1/"" target=""_blankLinux Network Security from Linux Planet a nice tutorial on network security

Tomorrow, we'll cover telephony support in your Linux kernel. PyMP3Cut ""PyMP3Cut is a Python commandline tool designed to cut huge (> 100MB) MP3 files at high speed without requiring the extra disk space and processing time usually needed by visual audio editing tools, which convert the MP3 format to more easily manageable formats like WAV before doing anything.

Linux PR is an up-to-the-minute listing of events and developments in the Linux world. The layout is attractive, with all the most recent articles in descending order on the front page. It makes quick scans easy. The only real downside to the news on the site is that some of it is very, very company-oriented - clearly the work of PR firms cranking out press releases. Other than that, Linux PR is a useful site for checking in and keeping up on your favorite OS.

Last week, search requests for information on 25-year-old Kan far outweighed the kind of requests on products and companies I usually see. A pioneer in the peer-to-peer space, many credit him with legitimizing file sharing--making it about more than music, according to Wired News. 2 http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=de-7tpkQMW4gxMQtE6tTbDS-BJjho4R"" >Macworld: The annual Apple lovefest in New York is always a good show, whether or not Steve Jobs has anything real to announce.

This time, Wi-Fi is getting interest because of a possible pact between tech heavyweights, including Intel, AT&T Wireless, and Verizon Communications, to build wireless access places across the nation in public areas where people would want to launch onto the Net, such as airports. 5 http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=1d-6KTjIGQTqzGejK3Rl28NRQSnqQPR"" >eMac: This is the for-education-only computer that consumers wanted so badly that Apple released it to them.

EDITOR'S CORNER How to Publish Your Windows XP FTP Server to the Internet
Several of you wrote in about last week's article on installing an FTP Server. You said ""that was great, but you only told half the story"". You wanted to know two more things: How to make the FTP Server available to Internet users
How to secure the FTP Server There are several ways to make an FTP server on the internal network available to users on the Internet. These methods are referred to as ""Server Publishing"". You can use a Windows XP computer running Internet Connection Services (ICS) to publish a server on your internal network. Let's take a look at a common scenario. You have a Windows XP computer connected to the Internet with an always-on cable or DSL connection. You have another computer on your private network also running Windows XP. You've installed the FTP Server on this internal network computer and put files into the FTP folder. Now you want Internet users to connect to the FTP Server through the ICS computer directly connected to the Internet. You can do this with the Windows XP ICS! Here's how: Go into the Network Connections window. You can get there from the Network applet in the Control Panel.
Right click the network interface directly connected to the Internet and click Properties.
Click on the Advanced tab in the connection's Properties dialog box. Put a checkmark in the Internet Connection Firewall checkbox. Always make sure the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled when you connect a computer directly to the Internet.
Click the Settings button, then click on the Services tab in the Advanced Settings dialog box.
Now click the Add button. This brings up the Service Settings dialog box. Type in My FTP Server in the Description of service text box. In the Name or IP address text box, type in the IP address of the computer on your private network that's running the FTP server. Since you're using ICS, it'll have an IP address like 192.168.0.x, where x is different for each machine on your network. You might want to manually assign the IP address the FTP Server already has, so that it doesn't change in the future. You can find out what IP address your FTP server is using by opening a command prompt at the FTP server and typing in the command ipconfig. That will give you the IP address the FTP Server is using. Back to the Service Settings dialog box, select the TCP option button. For the External Port and the Internet port, put in the port number you assigned to the FTP server on your internal network. Read this week's How To section to see how to change the listening port number. Clic!
k OK
Click OK, and then click OK one more time! You might need to disable and enable the adapter after making the change. You can do that by right clicking the always-on interface. The procedure is very similar for dial-up connections. However, there are problems with dial-up connections (and many always-on connections) because the IP address on the external interface of the ICS computer changes over time. Next week I'll share with you a cool way you can get around this problem by using something called a ""dynamic DNS service"". I've used one for years, and it works great. Make sure to tune in next week for the details. There you have it. Is server publishing in your future? Have any questions on the method I described above? If so, let me know! There are lots of ways you can publish services. Tell me how you do it, and tricks you've learned along the way. If you're having problems with server publishing, let me know about those too! I'll be sure to include what I learn from you in upcoming newsletters.

HINTS, TIPS, TRICKS & TWEAKS Allow Dial-up Connections to Synchronize Time with Internet Time Servers
Do you use a dial-up connection but can't get your machine to synchronize its clock with an Internet time server when the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled? If so, here's a tip Richard Surry sent in on how to fix the problem: Open your Network Connections window from the start menu.
Right click on your modem (or other dial-up connection) and click Properties.
Click on the Advanced tab. You already have a checkmark in the box that enables the ICF. Click on the Settings button.
Click on the Services tab, then click on the Add button in the Services tab.
That should open the Service Settings dialog box. In the Description box, put in Internet Time Service. For the Name or IP address of the computer hosting this service on your network, type in 127.0.0.1. Select the TCP protocol option button. For both the external and internal port numbers, type 123.
If you're online, disconnect and reconnect. Now synchronize the time by double click on the clock in the system tray and going to the Internet Time tab. This is an interesting tip, and it represents an even more interesting problem. For you network geeks out there, I'll ask you this question: Why should we allow unsolicited inbound connections for the Internet Time Service? The ICF should not block responses to solicited outbound connections, so why should we have to enable reverse NAT to make this work? HOW TO'S: ALL THE NEW XP FEATURES How to Secure an FTP Server on Windows XP Professional
Last week we went over how to install the Windows XP FTP Server. It will work fine after going through the steps outlined last week, but several of you asked for more information on how to secure the FTP Server because you wanted to connect it to the Internet. It's a very good idea to understand how FTP security works before putting the server on the Internet. Here are some suggestions: Open the Internet Information Services console from the Administrative Tools menu. In the left pane of the console, expand your server name and then expand the FTP Sites node.
Right click on the Default FTP Site and click the Properties command.
Click on the FTP Site tab. Notice that the default TCP Port is set to 21. This is the well-known port for FTP. You can increase security a bit by changing this port to another value that's in the 1026-65534 range. This secures it from poorly motivated click-kiddies and also allows you to get around your ISP blocking incoming connections to TCP port 21. Friends who connect to your FTP server will need to change the port number on their FTP client software as well.
The Windows XP FTP server has a hard coded limit of 10 simultaneous connections. You might want to change this to a lower number to reduce the chance of a LAN party on the external interface of the FTP server.
Put a checkmark in the Enable Logging checkbox. Click the Properties button to the right of the log format drop-down list box. Click the Daily option button on the General Properties tab. On the Extended Properties tab, select all of the Extended Properties. Click OK.
Click on the Security Accounts tab. Place a checkmark in the Allow only anonymous connections checkbox. This prevents users from sending username and password credentials to the FTP server. You don't want users to send credentials because those credentials are sent in ""clear text"", which can be read by anyone who's listening on the wire.
Click the Messages tab. Enter a Welcome message, an Exit message, and a message users will see if there are no available connections.
Click on the Home Directory tab. Make sure there is a checkmark in the Read and Log Visits checkboxes. REMOVE the checkmark in the Write checkbox. Note the location in the Local Path text box. Navigate to that path in the Windows Explorer.
Right click on the FTPROOT folder and click Properties.
Click on the Security tab. Make sure that SYSTEM has Full Control. Assign the IUSR_ account READ access only. Remove all other permissions for the IUSR account. Make sure you give Adminstrators Full Control tool. This allows you, the administrator on the FTP Server computer, to add, remove and change files in the FTPROOT folder. Stop and restart the FTP Server. Now your FTP server is secure and Internet bad guys won't be able to use it to distribute porno and bootlegged software. WINXP SECURITY: UPDATES & PATCHES Cumulative Patch for Windows Media Player
I think it was a couple months ago when I wrote about some serious problems with the Windows Media Player (WMP). At that time you could download a ""cumulative"" patch that would update the Media Player with the latest security fixes. Well, it's time to download another ""cumulative"" patch! A couple other problems were found in WMP that could cause some problems. To read more about the problem head on over to: http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709SE-WMP_Patch&mid=9665862091709486"" target=""_tophttp://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709SE-WMP_Patch You'll also find the download locations for Windows Media Player versions 6.4, 7.1 and 8.0 (XP) on that page.
Cumulative Patches for Excel and Word for Windows
If you run Microsoft Word or Excel, versions 2000 or 2002 (XP), then you need to head on over to the Microsoft site to download some security fixes. These fixes handle security glitches that could get you in trouble if you don't take care of them! Head on over to Microsoft's site where you can find individual fixes for each program. You only need download the fix that applies to your computer: http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709SE-Word_Excel_Patch&mid=9665862091709486"" target=""_tophttp://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709SE-Word_Excel_Patch UPGRADING & COMPATIBILITY ISSUES A Computer May Hang During a Heavy Load with an Ericsson HIS Modem
If your computer has a Ericsson HIS modem, you might experience a dreaded blue screen and see the message IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL. The problem is that you're downloading too much and your poor modem can't keep up! Microsoft recognizes that this isn't a problem with the modem, but with the modem driver. To download a fix visit Microsoft's site. After getting the fix, you can download as much as you like without worrying about blue screens! http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709UP-HIS_Modem&mid=9665862091709486"" target=""_tophttp://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709UP-HIS_Modem
Knowledge Base Search Center - If it is Not Broke, Do Not Break it!
It wasn't so long ago when you could search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for articles that came up in the last 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 90 days and 6 months. It was great! But Microsoft decided to ""fix"" the Knowledge Base search page, and now it really sucks! It's hard to find things that used to come up easily, the site is often down, and searching based on age of articles just doesn't work anymore. Try this: go to: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?ln=EN-US&pr=kbinfo&"" target=""_tophttp://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?ln=EN-US&pr=kbinfo& and on the left side of the page select Windows XP in the top drop down list box. Don't put anything in the For solutions containing...(optional) text box. Leave the Any of the words entered option selected in the Using drop down list box. For Maximum Age select 3 days. For Results Limit select 150 articles. Click Search Now. Whoa! Nothing. OK, it's reasonable to see no articles related to Windows XP in the last 3 days. Try again, this time using 7 days. Whaat? Still no articles. OK, it was a holiday week in the USA last week. Let's try 14 days. Nothing again! That seems sort of strange, doesn't it? Let's give it another try with 30 days. Still no articles! What's going on here? Keep trying for 6 months and one year. You still won't find anything. It's pretty sad, because this used to work. WINXP CONFIGURING & TROUBLESHOOTING A Description of the Repair Option on a Local Area Network or High-Speed Internet Connection
Here's the answer to a question I've had for a long time. What the heck does that ""Repair"" option for a network connection actually do? It's not in the help file, but it's on the Microsoft Web site. Here's what it does: Sends an ipconfig /renew
Flushes the ARP cache with a arp -d
Reloads the NetBIOS name cache with a nbtstat -R
Updates its WINS server with an nbtstat -RR
Clear out the DNS client cache with an ipconfig /flushdns
Reregisters the client with a DDNS server with a ipconfig /registerdns Check out the original article over at: http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709CO-Repair_Option&mid=9665862091709486"" target=""_tophttp://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709CO-Repair_Option
Keyboard and Mouse Do Not Work When You Start Windows
Have you been hit with this one? You're working in Windows XP and shut down for the day. The next morning you start up your Windows XP computer and the mouse pointer is stuck! The only way to get it going again is to restart the computer, and for some reason the pointer starts moving again. What's up with that? I still haven't figured that one out, but Microsoft has a KB article that claims it's from a corrupt registry. I doubt that's the case in my situation because the problem is intermittent. But if you find that your mouse is always stuck, you might want to check out: http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709CO-Frozen_Mouse&mid=9665862091709486"" target=""_tophttp://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709CO-Frozen_Mouse

Dear Reader, Basic electronic organizers they're not, but if you're searching for a pocket-sized computer for music, movies, and games, then these PDAs are well worth a look. All four models feature fast processors, large amounts of RAM, and sharp, color screens, which make them better choices for rich media than competing products. But beyond those basics, these handhelds are very different. You'll find three different operating systems: Pocket PC, Palm, and Linux. Two have keyboards, one has a built-in Bluetooth radio, and all four support various expansion card formats. Most Pocket PCs are multimedia friendly; we've picked two that really stand out because of features or price. However, none of these are inexpensive models, so check out our hands-on reviews to find the high-end handheld that you'll be happiest with. http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=78-d5asIdUkHpvIL5i5vnMUN5xspoRR"" >Audiovox Maestro PDA-1032

What's Hot in the World of DivX(tm) Video This Week:
Battle of the Planets in DivX, Warcraft III, and the Latest Skins
Now Sent to Over 1.6 Million DivX Fans Worldwide! Welcome to this week's edition of DivX News, your weekly fix of information about what's hot and what's cool in the world of DivX video. (You are being sent this email because you subscribed to this newsletter at DivX.com. If you'd like to unsubscribe, follow the instructions at the end of this message.) In This Week's Issue -------------------- 1. Classic Battle of the Planets in DivX Video 2. Warcraft III with DivX Video Sells like Hotcakes 3. Skins, Skins and More Skins Battle of the Planets in DivX Video! ------------------------------------ One of the best things about DivX Video is the way it has opened up distribution possibilities for a lot of cool videos that may not otherwise be widely seen. From independent short films to cult movies with strong underground followings, a number of filmmakers and distributors are discovering that DivX Video provides a great way to get their content in front of new audiences. A perfect example of that phenomenon is the groundbreaking animated series ""Battle of the Planets"" from Sandy Frank Entertainment. Originally shown on American television in the late 1970s, Battle of the Planets gained a popular following and was one of the forerunners of the wildly popular anime style. The series chronicled the adventures of a group of intergalactic adventurers as they battled evil and protected the universe from invaders. Beloved among anime fans, 70s nostalgia buffs, and anyone who enjoys great sci-fi animation, the series is the subject of a number of fan sites and discussion groups throughout the Internet. You can now re-live the adventures of the Battle of the Planets crew in high-quality DivX video. The classic episode ""Mammoth Shark Menace"" is currently featured on the DivX Showcase, and stay tuned for more news about future Battle of the Planets episodes to come. * Watch ""Battle of the Planets 55: Mammoth Shark Menace"" in the DivX Showcase: Warcraft III Sets Sales Records ------------------------------- A while ago, we told you that the highly anticipated game ""Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos"" from Blizzard Entertainment would feature DivX Video for cinematic cut scenes. In early July, Blizzard released ""Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos"" with record-setting results, shipping over 4.5 million copies to retailers. Coincidence? You be the judge. You can look forward to more announcements about DivX technology in some of your favorite games in the near future.... * Watch the ""Warcraft III"" Trailer in High-quality DivX Video: * Read more about the successful launch: The Latest DivX Player Skins ---------------------------- Let's face it--if you don't have the latest Player skins, you're just not cool. * DisPlayer: A sleek, stylish full-screen skin that will give you the home theatre experience on your PC. Submitted by ""DIVX Budman."" * Coldfusion: A futuristic skin design dripping in coolness. Submitted by ""gryphix."" * DVDesque: As the title suggests, this skin has a groovy DVD-player design to complement the DivX experience. Submitted by ""NellyNel.""

I had just finished giving http://ben.franske.com/Ben and his sister a ""behind
the scenes"" look at our set, when Patrick walked in and poked me
in the left arm repeatedly with his index finger - until I hung up
the phone and gave him my full, undivided attention. ""Did you know
that your GnomeTomes are being featured in the 'Barnes & Noble'
eBooks section,"" he asked. Well, that was news to me. After
flailing over to his workstation and flipping through a few pages,
we ultimately realized that he had discovered the entry on the
main page for http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=lockergnomedigit&path=tg/browse/-/551440/Amazon's
eBooks. Cool! ""With a name that inspires curiosity and sparks the imagination,
Lockergnome represents one of the latest and most popular
additions to our e-documents catalog. At prices starting under $3,
these eminently useful titles from one of the most fanciful-sounding
publishers we've encountered are hard to resist."" Thank
you for helping us along, gang. My ultimate goal is to kick that
Godin guy out of the top ten - if only for a day. PC World Picks I must now thank both Lockergnomie Dan Reain and Nancy Workman-Luter

users and professionals on a Windows OS, it's one of the best

done, then I bet it can't be done at all. Expect a full

the demo. If I can ever decide on a digital video camera,
perhaps their Vegas Video will sit on my system, too. Melanie and
I were talking about hardware options the other day. She's leaning
towards a Canon, too. Unless I hear or see otherwise, the ZR45MC
is at the top of my list. Still and low-light images aren't the
best, but I'm not really up for spending much more than $1000.
Neither is Gretchen, oddly enough. As much as I dislike the AOL client user interface, I gotta admit:
it's pretty darn powerful underneath. For instance, you can
""unsend"" an e-mail message (but only if it was sent to another
America Online member and s/he hasn't read it yet). If you travel
often, the service is a bargain. If you know someone who just
needs the Internet basics, it's perfect. One caveat: the software
puts RealPlayer on your system without asking you first. I was a
little upset when I discovered its icon sitting in my Start Menu.
Nowhere during the installation process did I see a way to opt out
of it. I'm not surprised; there are more advertisements on AOL
than there are from your average ""free"" Web page host. You may
have asked yourself: ""What is Chris doing installing AOL in the
first place?!"" I don't http://www.iblameyou.com/blame

But how do you really know if others consider you to be popular? Well, if you are talking about the popularity of your website (although the junior high kids are more concerned about the labels on your clothes), then all you have to do is download SEPopular. Search engines (such as Google) rank your site by determining how many people link to your site (the more people who link to your site, the better your ranking). With this investigative tool, you can see how many links to your website there are (from the perspective of five major search engines). You don't just have to check out your own website, though... all you have to do is enter the URL of a website, and out comes the TRUTH about its popularity. Another nice feature of this software is that you can import web addresses from a .txt file so that you don't have to enter each one individually. It's all about keeping up with thejoneses.com.

Anyway, MB-Ruler is quite a useful little application, especially for anyone who has had to work with banners and graphics for the Web. You can measure angles in radians or degrees, and distances in inches, centimeters, twips, points or pixels. And if those weren't enough options, you can even set your own scale.

I thought I had Outlook Express keeping track of it for me... If you use Outlook Express (for Windows 2000 or Windows XP) to check your e-mail, then this article is for you. Occasionally your password for Outlook Express is not retained, even though you have checked the ""Remember Password"" checkbox. To fix this particular issue, you will need Administrator privileges in order to make some modifications to your system's registry. The article contains steps for backing up your registry and, since you can cause a lot of accidental damage while tweaking the registry... I would recommend that you follow them.

Re-route E-mail Forwarding Service http://www.re-route.com/"" class=""URLhttp://www.re-route.com/ Soon, it will be time for us to fill out the change of address cards as we relocate to a different area of the city. You probably knew that your snail mail could be forwarded, but what about your e-mail? Back in the days of college e-mail accounts, every time I changed ISPs I had to send a mass e-mail to my contacts and hope they saved my new address, otherwise I could miss out on getting their correspondence. The great thing about Re-Route's service is that I don't have to worry about lost e-mails after changing ISPs. Sign up for the service, and they will take any e-mail sent to your old account and forward it to your new e-mail address. After that, Re-Route e-mails the sender to notify them of your new address. If you are with AOL, MSN, or any of their featured partners, then the first month is free. If not, then Re-Route charges a very nominal fee of ten bucks for the one month and twenty-five bucks for 3 months. Have someone else handle all my changing e-mail address need!
s? Sounds like money well spent! Just because it is summer and bright out doesn't mean that you should stop using your flash on your digital camera. Bright sunlight creates harsh shadows that may cause you to lose detail. Don't you hate those pictures where you can only see half of someone's face because the other half is black from a shadow? Well, the cure is in front of you... use your flash during the daytime to throw a little light into those shadows. Some cameras allow you to adjust how much flash is used, also known as flash exposure compensation. If you can adjust the output of your flash, then try it at the lowest setting first. Remember, you don't want to completely get rid of the shadows because they add depth to your photo. Keep increasing your flash output until you get your desired results. Also, as an extra tip, don't forget that you can conserve battery life on your digital camera by turning on the autofocus option and turning off the LCD display.

Apple CEO Steve Jobs kicked off the trade show by http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=14-5MRAIF-I438XVu98ZvQIzTKtR1dR"" >unveiling new iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac. The new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the existing 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod for $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three models for Windows users with MusicMatch software. As expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel monitor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolution versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac. Jobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will be on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change the background photo as often as every 5 seconds. But fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there's no such thing as a cheap upgrade when the company announced it will http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=29-Sg_rIjM3xjSzf59NyGEI9rCM8vcR"" >not offer a discounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to current users of the operating system. To get Jaguar, current OS X users will have to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating system for the retail price of $129. Apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qualitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions share the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and services, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvous, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software. Apple also raised eyebrows by http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3e-F51nIizcfoh9HOq_7DQESNPe-iRR"" >transitioning its iTools Web services from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans to charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web services was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other features. Despite iTool's popularity, the company http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=53-n86dINniBiqIX-sjHpx8lOheMnlR"" >may face a tough sell with the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture. Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously free services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple's efforts to form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently. To its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organized than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However, an http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=68-iM8qIsPWu8FuzAvywvjsK-FdLP4R"" >online petition protesting the new charges doesn't bode well for the program. Not one to be caught in anyone's shadow, Microsoft plans to http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=7d-FFEqIDLWMEqg-q9Uywq2NRJSBTeR"" >offer a rebate for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version of the software. The offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have not met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000 copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the program went on sale last November. Microsoft is also putting the http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=93-V4PmQSdrF0o9nH2cTYjvQ8Rgn5FR"" >finishing touches on the third collection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, contains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the operating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 could be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security fixes are available as separate downloads. Not everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Microsoft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=a8-02XZQQZDjZijEBtDtZs6swzdON9R"" >shut down a site that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. The company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java inventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004. You better watch what you write in Yahoo's free e-mail service--because Yahoo is. To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=bd-c0nUQ7pV9moRKw2pAEVgnfqGsJuR"" >swap out a handful of words such as ""mocha"" and ""eval"" that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript. The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web enhanced"" can contain JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example. ""Mocha"" is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced e-mail. Typing ""mocha:"" into the location bar of the Netscape browser will open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which commands can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person's knowledge. On the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's Web use, the U.S. government is again turning to technology to http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=d2-THo_QULs_DzX3rh3Gl22vbAOyesR"" >monitor suspicious activity in the name of fighting terrorism. The government has unveiled more details of its Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a plan to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or suspicious behavior. ""The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the daily course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual or suspicious activity in public places,"" according to the TIPS Web site. But the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several critics of the plan, fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possibly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant.

Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. http://www.gnomedex.comRegister for Gnomedex today! This year's http://www.sic.orgSIC gets the blame for the lateness of this issue. Lori and I spent Wednesday thru Sunday meeting software authors, participating in educational sessions, viewing product demonstrations, and most of all having fun. This was Lori's second trip to an SIC conference, so she got to reacquaint herself with many familiar faces, while I was getting to put faces with many people I've exchanged e-mails with over the last several years. As much as I enjoy information exchange via computer, the human interaction of meeting people and sharing ideas and stories face-to-face is priceless. One cool discovery at this year's SIC, pertaining directly to Webmasters, is Nick Bradbury's release of http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/index.aspTopStyle 3.0. Nick's the guy who created HomeSite, long before it joined the Macromedia family of products. Version 3 represents a return to those HTML editing roots, with the addition of editing capabilities now functioning hand-in-hand with the rock solid style sheet building features that previously defined TopStyle. Conversion of existing font tags to CSS is just one of several new additions. I should have a full review in one of the next two issues. Also in the coming soon category - a GnomeTome on Cold Fusion, written by one of Iowa's resident ColdFusion experts (who also happens to be an expert on an International level), Kevin Schmidt. Kevin wrote the http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201758474/ref=ase_lockergnome""Training From the Source book on Cold Fusion 5 and is currently writing a revision for ColdFusionMX. The GnomeTome means we'll have a nice pairing of tips for both static pages, in the form of http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001691.htmlDreamweaver tips, and tips on dynamic site development with Kevin's tips on ColdFusion.

Listen to Lockergnomie Dale Lowery and you'll save time
immediately. It's an old tip, but it bears repeating: ""I'll often
find Web snippets I'd like to keep - but I don't want to save the
entire page. So, I've HOT-KEYED Notepad. Easy! Get to the most
common Notepad shortcut icon: Start | Programs | Accessories |
Notepad. Then right-click on the menu item and select Properties.
You'll see that this is (indeed) a shortcut; in the lower part of
the dialog is a field to add a hotkey. I entered 'N' for Notepad,
Windows offered CTRL and ALT as a prefix, and now I can launch
Notepad in an instant. I highlight the text I want to keep, copy
it, tap my shortcut, paste it, and then save the new text file
wherever I want. Most often, I use this trick to copy paragraphs
that describe downloads (and save them as text files in the same
folder as the download)."" Just make sure you don't pick a keyboard
shortcut that's already in use. Otherwise, one of them is gonna
get cranky. And while we're taking a trip down memory lane, Lockergnomie Ian
Rich reminds us of Jouni Vuorio's utility: The site is
http://www.jv16.org/jv16.org. The program is called
jv16 Power Tools, and this freeware is truly worthy of praise. It
combines a full-on registry management tool with several file
manager tools: one to hunt down temporary files in any format and
the other to help perform advanced file searches and comparisons.
Mainly, I wanted the program to be brought to the attention of the
consumer public, as it moves further and further along in
development it just keeps getting better. I've used it on windows
Me, and now XP - without crashes or hair-raising Registry
corruption. It backs up everything it changes and is very easy to
use. If you're interested in something of shareware-quality with
forum support (for absolutely nothing), get this program. Anyway,
I love the newsletter and the work you guys and gals do at
Lockergnome. I hope that this author gets his recognition.""
Consider this a huge nod! I love a good resource, and Lockergnomie Elton Jonsson from the
United Kingdom has one for us, too: ""As a dedicated subscriber, I
just had to tell about this one. Have you ever been driven mad
trying to find out the name of the piece of music on a television
advert? Well, at last, here in the UK, we have an answer to that
problem and, given that many multinationals use the same
advertising in the USA as they do here, it may help out you guys
as well. Check out http://www.commercialbreaksandbeats.co.uk/Commercial
Breaks and Beats. I have no connection with it; I'm just
grateful that someone has had the brilliant idea of creating it.
If you check the message board on the site, you'll see that I'm
not alone."" This http://directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Television/Commercials/Google
Directory can help fill in the blanks, I'm sure. I
almost fell out of my chair the other day when I heard ""Yeh Yeh""
(by TMBG) being played on a Chrysler advertisement. Way to go:
John, John, Dan, Dan, and Dan! You're the dogs kids love to bite. And what's say we round out the report with another tip?
Lockergnomie David Brown can oblige: ""The e-mail forwarding
service is a good idea, but you can do it yourself with Outlook
Express. Set up two accounts (one for your old account and one for
your new one). Craft your reply in a new message and save it.
Then, select Tools | Message Rules | Mail | New rule. Check 'Where
the message is from specified account' in the first section.
'Reply with message"" in section two. Select the appropriate
account and message in the final section. Name it. You can also
have the messages flagged or moved to another folder if you want
to know which messages came from the old account. Once the rule
has been created, any mail from the old account will have a reply
sent. People should learn about mail rules, anyway."" True! So,
what rule simplifies your day? Latest Downloads QuicKalendar v1.0.2 [430k] W9x/2k/XP FREE http://www.trinfinitysoftware.com/quickalendar.shtmlhttp://www.trinfinitysoftware.com/quickalendar.shtml {Calendar utility} You say you want to get together on the 25th, but what DAY is that? I'm not good with calendar dates; truth be told, I don't even know what day of the week it is most the time. If I didn't have my PDA armed with a Calendar with me, then I wouldn't show up to anything on time, let alone on the right day. Well, that is great for when I am mobile, but what about when I am in front of my PC? The PDA is docked, but that doesn't mean I have to be without a calendar... enter QuicKalendar! ""QuicKalendar gives you quick and easy access to a calendar whenever you need it. You can view the calendar on screen, or print it out to jot down notes and appointments."" You need to keep in mind that the print feature is relative to how you have QuicKalendar displayed on your machine. If you are in full screen mode, then the printout will be bigger than a standard sheet of letter paper. If you try printing in normal view, then the printout will be too small to write on. My suggestion is to play with the size of QuicKalendar's screen until you get a printout that you can be proud of. Now, you'll have no reason to be late for Gnomedex! Diatris v1.0 [407k] W9x/2k/XP FREE http://www.webruler.com/mtreciokas/http://www.webruler.com/mtreciokas/ {Tetris-like game} I've always been fascinated with geometric shapes. To me everything has to be somewhat symmetrical... even my hair! So it was no wonder why I was addicted to playing the game Tetris for so many years. The only problem with Tetris is that, after awhile, it starts to get a little too easy. Diatris is a bundle of three different - and much more challenging - Tetris-like games. ""For the first game, Y-Diatris, the objects can move vertically and diagonally. The second game, X-Diatris, the objects can move only in two diagonal directions; the vertical drop is taken out. For the last game H-Diatris the objects can only move vertically and horizontally like most block drop games."" I won't kid you, these games can be pretty hard, but if you are a Tetris fan, then these set of games are for you. If you're not a Tetris fan, don't worry, there are a few other games you might like on this site, so check it out! http://www.infopackets.com/cgi-bin/click.cgi?id=83

This article also discusses how to troubleshoot common issues with CD-R and CD-RW devices. The steps in this article apply to compact disc (CD-ROM) drives, compact disc recordable (CD-R) drives, compact disc re-writable (CD-RW) drives, and digital video disc (DVD) drives."" To summarize, you should try the steps on this site before calling your technical support. Some of the steps include closing unnecessary software, testing the disc in a different computer, and cleaning the disc. Make sure to clean a disc by wiping from the center of the disc outward... if you wipe the disc in a circular fashion, then you risk scratching it. The steps in this article will only serve to save you time, as you will probably be able to fix most disc problems by following the steps. If this article doesn't help you resolve your disc problem, look on the bright side... you won't have to spend so much time on the phone with technical support, because you'll already know what the problem ISN'T! Modem Spy v3.1.3b [230k] W9x/2k/XP $25 Unearthed by Sergei Polishchuk http://www.modemspy.com/http://www.modemspy.com/ {Answering machine} ""Modem spy is a handy utility for phone calls recording. Features: 1) Records phone conversations. 2) Records from microphone. 3) Plays back recorded messages via phone line. 4) Plays back recorded messages via sound card. 5) Can record ALL incoming phone calls. 6) Has built-in software automatic gain control. 7) Detects and logs Caller ID."" Gnomie Brian Stevens tried this one out for us, but had a small problem testing this on any of his machines... he doesn't have any modems! Brian says, ""I was able to load the program, though, and try a few of the features out. You can record an audio memo to your machine, much like an answering machine. You can also e-mail this audio memo, although I don't recommend you do that as the WAV file didn't seem to play well when I tried e-mailing it to myself (which may have been due to the microphone it was recorded with). Other than that, Modem Spy is a solid program and is a great alternative to buying a traditional answering machine... plus in most cases it is cheaper!"" Keep in mind that, for Caller ID to work, you need the Caller ID service turned on by your phone service provider.

The Avocado Papers Unearthed by Meryl Evans http://www.theavocadopapers.com/http://www.theavocadopapers.com/ After surfing serious Web site upon serious Web site, you just need to find a site where you can relax and have a good time. TheAvocadoPapers.com is one of those sites that is a little bit goofy but extremely creative. It isn't that the Web site is really about anything; there is some creative writing (usually rather funny) and the occasional interview (this week ""Steve Schneider Interviews Himself""). If you are a little bit nosy, and want to peek into the lives of others, you can read Ron Bork's diary or enter the Avocado Chat. Although the makers of the Web site don't even know what it is about, I think it is quite apparent... fun! Go check out the Web site for yourself and see if you can pin down its rhyme or reason. Worst-case scenario, you can always sign up for their current promotion... free linguine! This tip is for the Windows XP users out there. ""The Windows XP operating system achieves excellent performance in part by dynamic adjustments that it makes in response to how a system is utilized. In particular, many adjustments are made when the system first runs following setup and when newly installed applications are used for the first time. These adjustments greatly influence the performance of the system. Unfortunately, the dynamic nature of Windows XP can make benchmarking more of a challenge than with previous Windows versions."" To properly benchmark your Windows XP system, there are a few steps you should follow. The step with which we are concerned in this particular tip is letting your PC process any ""idle tasks."" Idle tasks are tasks that your PC executes when it deems the system to be unused or idle. Some of these include file placement optimization, system restore, and done-once-after-setup work items. ""All of these 'idle tasks' are controllable by a system API in advapi32.dll, ProcessIdleTasks. The API's sole purpose is to allow benchmarks a simple way to force any pending idle tasks to be executed immediately, without having to wait a lengthy period of time. To call ProcessIdleTasks from the command line, use this syntax: Rundll32.exe advapi32.dll,ProcessIdleTasks."" Once running, it may take up to around 15 minutes to process all of the idle tasks, and your hard drive will be active through most of it.

I did a lot this weekend, but I didn't really get much done, ya know? My knees are killing me from hauling stuff out of the basement for storage up in the attic, but the pile only made it as far as the kitchen. Then I stripped and painted the floor where that collection of stuff was previously stored, and erected some shelving so I'd have room for more stuff. I woke up the next morning discover a very sick ferret, likely from the fumes that leeched into the next room over despite the ventilation I had setup to prevent the migration of bad air. So, I ended up dismantling the ferret cage to move it upstairs for a week or so until I'm sure it's safe. Thankfully, all critters are doing well now. I also started in on replacing the cheapo rusted screws with stainless steel deck screws out back, but found that the ones I picked up are too weak, leaving me with stripped out heads and bent shafts. That project stopped after barely getting started. The front steps are also in need of rust-
proof screws, but they are made from much softer wood, so I moved the tools to the other side of the house. Two-thirds of the way through the first row, I found that the extra 1/2"" on the screws I purchased was too much and I began running into the top of the old concrete steps underneath. Figures. Live and learn. Oh well, it was entirely too hot to work outside anyway. Back down to the basement I went to geek out instead. Roughly an hour into geekitude, I glanced over and realized it was 78.7 degrees in the basement and I was virtually stuck to my chair from the sweat. I shut off as much as I really could and still work on a couple of projects, but it didn't help the heat situation much. It was just too hot outside for the air conditioner to keep up with the added heat from the computers. That left me in need of a shower and with only the notebook in the living room for the balance of the weekend. I cleaned out a lot of ancient email, which was nice, but nothing really got accomplished otherwise. Boy, am I tired. And the weekend is so far away. Hey, the second season of M*A*S*H comes out on DVD tomorrow! That should put me in better spirits. I could watch M*A*S*H for hours on end. In fact, I often do just that. The only kink is that the episodes don't play back-to-back from DVD. I'm going to play with AppleScript on the Mac to see if I can customize how the individual discs play. In theory, I should be able to make a disc play all the way through. If I succeed, I'll be sure to share the script technique in the http://applecore.lockergnome.com/AppleCore newsletter. Too bad I can't do that with a stand-alone DVD player. Slow File Save Dialog Boxes Pointed out by Ian Hargreaves http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q321126http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q321126 I've hated this one for a long time, and now we have a hotfix and a workaround, so take your pick as to which will work best. I often map drive letters to specific network shares, and if I happen to have a system turned off, I'll notice a significant delay when clicking the drop-down boxes in Open, Look In or Save In/As dialog boxes. Windows 2000 attempts to reconnect to mapped resources before showing you the list, and depending on how many drives you have mapped and how many of those resources are unavailable, it can take eons just to save a file. A workaround is to use the My Network Places functionality instead of mapping drive letters. Fine for some, but I prefer having drive letters mapped for many things, being that I work at a command prompt quite a bit, and it's easier to navigate that way. Alternatively, a hotfix is now available, but you'll have to contact Microsoft to obtain the fix if that's the route you choose. Customized 9x/ME Blue Screen Errors http://www.vsres.com/blscrn/http://www.vsres.com/blscrn/ We've all seen 'em. Those annoyingly incoherent blue screens indicating a system error of some sort, but provide no real help in solving the problem. If you're a programmer that has had to deal with error conditions produced by Windows 95/98/ME, then this might be a better way to handle them within your applications. Blue Screen v1.21 is an ActiveX control that uses the standard Windows system error functions, but provides a way to pass along text and response options you designate. Note that this is not functional on Windows NT/2000/XP, which handle system errors in an entirely different manner. Gamers Beware of Intel 845G Chipset http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4532http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4532 http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4513http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4513 Discount the AMD hype and returned volley from Intel when reading up on all of this, but one thing is painfully clear. The Intel 845G chipset and P4 Celeron processors really don't provide an acceptable gaming experience. Not only is performance subject to ridicule, but compatibility is also looking to be a serious matter. Intel has never claimed that Celerons were high-end desktop processors, but they have typically provided a decent enough experience that they can make for acceptable machines for the more budget-minded consumer. The compatibility issues with this particular version of Celeron and the 845G chipset are something to watch out for. Once the Celeron is moved to the .13 micron core, I suspect the performance concern won't remain, but the 845G alone seems to have it's own problems without adding the Celeron misery. The lesson in knowing what hardware you're buying is what's important here.

Too Cool http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,102779,00.asphttp://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,102779,00.asp This was just too interesting not to mention. Water-cooled systems are all-the-rage among overclockers and those that seem to need bragging rights over their friends' computer systems. Hitachi is taking a chapter from that tome and applying the concept where it's truly needed - notebook computers. Believe me when I say that these suckers get very hot. I spend half my life with notebook planted on lap, and I have to put something between the two surfaces to avoid my own little heat stroke. Fans and the mini water cooling system Hitachi is implementing provide roughly the same heat mitigation efficiency, but without the noise. The concept of a water-cooled notebook sounds a little odd, but I would welcome the elimination of the turbine droning with open arms.

CERT Advisory <cert-advisory@cert.org>,CERT Advisory CA-2002-21 Vulnerability in PHP," -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- CERT Advisory CA-2002-21 Vulnerability in PHP Original release date: July 22, 2002 Last revised: -- Source: CERT/CC A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file. Systems Affected * Systems running PHP versions 4.2.0 or 4.2.1 Overview A vulnerability has been discovered in PHP. This vulnerability could be used by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash PHP and/or the web server. I. Description PHP is a popular scripting language in widespread use. For more information about PHP, see http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.general.php The vulnerability occurs in the portion of PHP code responsible for handling file uploads, specifically multipart/form-data. By sending a specially crafted POST request to the web server, an attacker can corrupt the internal data structures used by PHP. Specifically, an intruder can cause an improperly initialized memory structure to be freed. In most cases, an intruder can use this flaw to crash PHP or the web server. Under some circumstances, an intruder may be able to take advantage of this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server. You may be aware that freeing memory at inappropriate times in some implementations of malloc and free does not usually result in the execution of arbitrary code. However, because PHP utilizes its own memory management system, the implementation of malloc and free is irrelevant to this problem. Stefan Esser of e-matters GmbH has indicated that intruders cannot execute code on x86 systems. However, we encourage system administrators to apply patches on x86 systems as well to guard against denial-of-service attacks and as-yet-unknown attack techniques that may permit the execution of code on x86 architectures. This vulnerability was discovered by e-matters GmbH and is described in detail in their advisory. The PHP Group has also issued an advisory. A list of vendors contacted by the CERT/CC and their status regarding this vulnerability is available in VU#929115. Although this vulnerability only affects PHP 4.2.0 and 4.2.1, e-matters GmbH has previously identified vulnerabilities in older versions of PHP. If you are running older versions of PHP, we encourage you to review http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012002.html II. Impact A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. An attacker may not be able to execute code on x86 architectures due to the way the stack is structured. However, an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to crash PHP and/or the web server running on an x86 architecture. III. Solution Apply a patch from your vendor Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory. As vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we will update this section and note the changes in our revision history. If a particular vendor is not listed below, we have not received their comments. Please contact your vendor directly. Upgrade to the latest version of PHP If a patch is not available from your vendor, upgrade to version 4.2.2. Deny POST requests Until patches or an update can be applied, you may wish to deny POST requests. The following workaround is taken from the PHP Security Advisory: If the PHP applications on an affected web server do not rely on HTTP POST input from user agents, it is often possible to deny POST requests on the web server. In the Apache web server, for example, this is possible with the following code included in the main configuration file or a top-level .htaccess file: Order deny,allow Deny from all Note that an existing configuration and/or .htaccess file may have parameters contradicting the example given above. Disable vulnerable service Until you can upgrade or apply patches, you may wish to disable PHP. As a best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling all services that are not explicitly required. Before deciding to disable PHP, carefully consider your service requirements. Appendix A. - Vendor Information This appendix contains information provided by vendors for this advisory. As vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we will update this section and note the changes in our revision history. If a particular vendor is not listed below, we have not received their comments. Apple Computer Inc. Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server are shipping with PHP version 4.1.2 which does not contain the vulnerability described in this alert. Caldera Caldera OpenLinux does not provide either vulnerable version (4.2.0, 4.2.1) of PHP in their products. Therefore, Caldera products are not vulnerable to this issue. Compaq Computer Corporation SOURCE: Compaq Computer Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard Company and Hewlett-Packard Company HP Services Software Security Response Team x-ref: SSRT2300 php post requests At the time of writing this document, Compaq is currently investigating the potential impact to Compaq's released Operating System software products. As further information becomes available Compaq will provide notice of the availability of any necessary patches through standard security bulletin announcements and be available from your normal HP Services supportchannel. Cray Inc. Cray, Inc. does not supply PHP on any of its systems. Debian Debian GNU/Linux stable aka 3.0 is not vulnerable. Debian GNU/Linux testing is not vulnerable. Debian GNU/Linux unstable is vulnerable. The problem effects PHP versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1. Woody ships an older version of PHP (4.1.2), that doesn't contain the vulnerable function. FreeBSD FreeBSD does not include any version of PHP by default, and so is not vulnerable; however, the FreeBSD Ports Collection does contain the PHP4 package. Updates to the PHP4 package are in progress and a corrected package will be available in the near future. Guardian Digital Guardian Digital has not shipped PHP 4.2.x in any versions of EnGarde, therefore we are not believed to be vulnerable at this time. Hewlett-Packard Company SOURCE: Hewlett-Packard Company Security Response Team At the time of writing this document, Hewlett Packard is currently investigating the potential impact to HP's released Operating System software products. As further information becomes available HP will provide notice of the availability of any necessary patches through standard security bulletin announcements and be available from your normal HP Services support channel. IBM IBM is not vulnerable to the above vulnerabilities in PHP. We do supply the PHP packages for AIX through the AIX Toolbox for Linux Applications. However, these packages are at 4.0.6 and also incorporate the security patch from 2/27/2002. Mandrakesoft Mandrake Linux does not ship with PHP version 4.2.x and as such is not vulnerable. The Mandrake Linux cooker does currently contain PHP 4.2.1 and will be updated shortly, but cooker should not be used in a production environment and no advisory will be issued. Microsoft Corporation Microsoft products are not affected by the issues detailed in this advisory. Network Appliance No Netapp products are vulnerable to this. Red Hat Inc. None of our commercial releases ship with vulnerable versions of PHP (4.2.0, 4.2.1). SuSE Inc. SuSE Linux is not vulnerable to this problem, as we do not ship PHP 4.2.x. _________________________________________________________________ The CERT/CC acknowledges e-matters GmbH for discovering and reporting this vulnerability. _________________________________________________________________ Author: Ian A.

Lockergnome's Guide to Converting Vinyl LPs to CD is no longer free. Over the last 10 days, almost 4,000 people downloaded the free tome. Of that 4,000, close to half put in a fake e-mail address, resulting in a ridiculous number of bounce messages in my inbox. Add to that the fact that several of the clever individuals used other people's real addresses, which then amounted to complaints of spam from the address owners. It's not worth providing a free service if it causes Lockergnome to be labeled a spammer as a result. The crowning gem was the in-duh-vidual who used the name A** Hole and Chris's personal address to download the PDF. On a more positive note, the guide is http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001962.htmlnow available in all six formats, for the minimal price of $5, complete with some additional content based on a couple reader suggestions. Chris may have an obsession with Peets coffee, but I'll bet he's never been the daily special. On my visit to St. Louis, for the http://www.sic.orgSIC, I started every morning with a walk to the West Port Starbucks. Apparently my morning ritual was a source of entertainment for the employees, which evolved into discussions of a reality based TV show based on the concept of stalking me. I've even got the http://www.lockergnome.com/images/jakepics/starbucks.jpgincriminating evidence to prove it. The SIC provided me the opportunity to see some cool updates to a couple titles, in addition to being introduced to some useful audio oriented titles I'd never seen before. Expect a number of reviews over the next several weeks, as well as extensive coverage of last week's events in St. Louis in the annual SIC special issue. Lori managed to score a few more Gnomedex giveaways while we were in attendance, so those of you who sign up will be coming home with even more goodies, which, by the way, aren't of the stressball and pen variety -- we're talking software titles with reg codes.

DreamQuest Championship Card Games For Pocket PC, Palm, Symbian OS http://www.dq.com/palm.htmlhttp://www.dq.com/palm.html Playing games on a PDA has killed plenty of my time spent waiting in airports around the US. With the recent porting of these three classic PC card games from DreamQuest, I've added some of the best in PC entertainment to my arsenal of PDA diversions. Hearts, Spades and Euchre all play in a similar manner to their PC versions, only on a smaller screen. Available for Pocket PC, Palm, and even the Symbian OS, you can play cards against computer opponents or connect to the online game room and challenge other players using any of the games multiple platforms. This is a unique experience currently unavailable for any other pocket games.

I saw these guys play a show in Omaha, back in January of this year and was blown away by their stage presence. Rexway rip through an opening set with enough energy to kick-start even the most somber crowd, moving everyone in the audience to their feet and setting the scene for an entertaining evening. As with most punk, the lyrics are equal parts politics and angst, with enough colorful language to drop a jaw or two. Tool fans should check out the countrified version of the classic HWAP; it's kind of like a cover tune, only more unique. If you are offended by 4-letter words, this band isn't for you.

Croupier (NR) 1998 Drama - 94min Reviewer's Tilt (9) In disembodied first person Clockwork style narration, Croupier
pessimistically compares our lives to those of hapless casino gamblers.
We know the odds are stacked against us, yet we continue to play the
games. Gamblers, or ""punters"" as they are more derogatorily known,
however, play their games under the watchful eyes of the croupier
(casino dealer). Constantly pulled by the siren song of fast money, the
croupier knows better than anyone that to play is to lose. Thus, the
cool croupier relegates himself to his addiction of watching others
lose. Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) is the croupier, raised by his croupier
father (Nicholas Ball) who taught him all the tricks of the trade.
Through his losses both in the casino and in his personal life, Jack's
father also taught Jack that the only way to win is not to play. Punters
are sorry sods; the croupier is king. From father to son, the lesson
passes -- watching others strive and falter is the only real enjoyment
in life. Despite decades of croupier training, Jack is compelled to
write the great novel burning deep inside him, yearning to escape.
Jack's publisher regrettably relates to Jack that his novel idea is
trite; stories of real life graft and corruption are what sell. When
Jack's father informs Jack of a casino opening in a small London Casino,
Jack snatches the opportunity to parlay his skill into a novel exposing
the seedy underbelly of London's casinos. Unfortunately, Jack's ex-cop
girlfriend sees the job hardening and irreparably changing Jack for the
worst. In an attempt to fool himself, Jack creates alter ego ""Jake"" to
bear the brunt of inequity, attempting to maintain Jack both morally and
physically unscathed. The absence of any clear delineation between the
personas becomes apparent when a lovely punter (Alex Kingston)
approaches Jack with a scheme to rob the casino. Jack slowly comes to
the realization that no one can have it both ways, either in the casino
or in life. You are either in the game, or you are not. Seasoned veteran
director Michael Hodges deftly crafts this tale around the subtle
talents of the ultra cool Clive Owen. Owen rules this drama, not with
flex and volume, but with glances and nods. Less is truly more, much
more, in this low budget escape from the unsatisfying blockbuster
suspense films of recent memory. Croupier proves that it is not a large
budget, but direction, dialogue and acting that drive the genre. Region 1 Encoding (US and Canada only)

THE MISSING LINK | Scot has cyber tomb with a view Sometimes an epitaph just can't be the last word. Billy Kemp was a
great Scot who died a couple of years ago at the young age of 52. He
was a councilman, husband, father and pillar of his community. His
family couldn't possibly post all that on a tombstone. But they did
manage to fit http://www.billykemp.org.uk/ on there. Yep, Kemp's
tombstone doubles as a billboard for his Web site, created
posthumously by his son as a tribute to his father's life. The grave
site has gotten more than 33,000 hits, perhaps more visits than the
gravesite! SOURCE: vnunet

WROX ANNOUNCEMENTS
========== Author Interviews ***With François Liger, Craig McQueen and Paul Wilton, authors of Visual
Basic .NET Text Manipulation Handbook. [AP] What do you think this book brings to the Visual Basic .NET
developer, and so who do you think needs this book? [CM] The book provides a quick easy reference for string programming
tasks. String manipulation is a large part of programming and it is
difficult to remember it all. Having an accessible reference assists in
finding existing code to do the job rather than rewriting something that
is already in the platform. It's valuable for all .NET developers. [PW] I think all VB.NET developers need this book. String handling and
regular expressions are not arcane topics for high-flying gurus - they are
the stuff of everyday programming! The regular expression chapters give a
great insight into what at first can seem a tricky topic. In addition the
regular expression reference at the back of the book is worth its weight
in gold - certainly more readable than all the documentation I had to work
with when writing the book. [AP] In two sentences, explain what strings are in .NET. Read the interview in full:

http://www.wrox.com/ACON11.asp?ISBN=1861007302&tid026 ***With Tobin Titus, author of Visual Basic .NET Threading Handbook In June, Wrox brought out a slim 260-page volume on threading in VB.NET.
There has been some confusion as to why we would want to bring a book out
on what seems a straightforward topic. In this article we interview Tobin
Titus (one of the authors on this title) and ask him various questions on
the book, as well getting his opinions on various programming-related
topics. What is free threading? Free threading is the ability to control execution to the utmost within an
application. While VB developers have been able to control some aspects of
threading in the past, they haven't been completely free to control those
threads in the manner that they desire. Free threading allows the
developer to make decisions on when a thread should start, when it should
end, and what it should do while executing. Read the interview in full here:

this week - we are making this week's code download \ support material
available to all non-subscribers (providing they are a member of the Wrox
Developer Community, which is free to join). This week's case study: Generating Design Patterns Using CodeDOM http://www.csharptoday.com/content/articles/20020722.asp?&tid026 The Code Document Model (CodeDOM), which provides the ability to generate
source code in a number of the managed languages, is a very powerful .NET
facility and has attracted much interest. Within Visual Studio .NET, a
complementary though unrelated feature is provided by the CodeModel
object, which allows programmatic access to hand-written code. Together
these two tools provide a platform from which it should be possible to
develop a VS.NET add-in to streamline the production of common designs in
code. This case study follows the development of such a tool, which
attempts to automate the generation of a widespread design pattern in an
existing C# or VB.NET project. ***Get on the Fast Track to Success If you are an experienced programmer who needs to get up to speed on core
.NET Technologies as quickly as possible, the Fast Track series is for
you. The Fast Track books complement our Beginning and Professional series by
providing concise guides to core topics. They deliver the essential facts
and understanding that are required to start taking advantage of .NET. By
targeting specific groups of experienced developers, the books are able to
concentrate on providing valuable information rather than covering basics. Read the full article here:

"""Ayn Rand Institute Media"" <davidh@aynrand.org>",GOVERNMENT REGULATION IS KILLING THE STOCK MARKET,"PRESS RELEASE FROM THE AYN RAND INSTITUTE
2121 Alton Parkway, Suite 250
Irvine CA 92606 July 24, 2002
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE GOVERNMENT REGULATION IS KILLING THE STOCK MARKET IRVINE, CA -- The steep decline in the stock market is being fueled
by investors' realization that increasing government constraints on
corporate America will harm business and the economy--not help them, said
Yaron Brook, executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute. ""Instead of launching a witch-hunt against CEOs and rushing to give
the government wider powers over business, we should get rid of the complex
and contradictory regulations that encourage bad accounting and prevent
shareholders from acting in their own interest."" ""The common explanation that 'greed' is to blame makes no sense--the
abuses in companies like Enron and WorldCom were not exercises in
self-interest, but in self-destruction. ""In an unfettered free market the desire for profit is satisfied by
honest, long-range, rational behavior: by innovating, by hiring the best
employees, by selling quality products and by providing accurate information
to the owners of the corporation--the shareholders. As for short-range
managers, the markets will not tolerate them. As for the real swindlers,
existing laws against force and fraud are sufficient to protect us."" ""If our politicians are indeed concerned about the stock market,""
said Dr. Brook, ""let them demonstrate it by eliminating, not adding,
regulations and making the market truly free."" ### ### ### Ayn Rand Institute executive director Dr. Yaron Brook is available for
interviews on this topic. Contact: Larry Benson
E-mail: larryb@aynrand.org
Phone: (949) 222-6550 ext. 213 Read Dr. Brook's full Op-Ed at:

Libertarian Party Announcements <owner-announce@lp.org>,LP RELEASE: Outrageous military spending,"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- ===============================

=============================== Thousands spent on strippers, golf memberships
shows Pentagon spending is out of control, Libertarians say WASHINGTON, DC -- Quiz question: Which of the following items have been charged to the taxpayers recently by military personnel wielding government-issued credit cards? (a) $38,000 for lap dancing at strip clubs near military bases. (b) $3,400 for a Sumo wrestling suit and $9,800 for Halloween costumes. (c) $7,373 for closing costs on a home and $16,000 for a corporate golf membership. (d) $4,600 for white beach sand and $19,000 worth of decorative ""river rock"" at a military base in the Arabian desert. (e) all of the above. ""Incredibly, the answer is 'all of the above,' said Steve Dasbach, Libertarian Party executive director. ""Thanks to the federal government's policy of doling out credit cards with no questions asked, the military has launched a raid on your wallet."" The shocking revelations are contained in a General Accounting Office audit released last week that uncovered $101 million in ""seemingly unneeded expenditures"" made by the Air Force and Army in 2000 and 2001. The purchases were made possible by the federal government's lax credit card policy: At least 1.4 million Defense Department employees carry credit cards, and last year they used them to splurge on $6.1 billion in goods and services, the audit found. In one case, a group of 200 soldiers used their military IDs and government-issued travel cards to get cash at adult-entertainment bars, then spent the money there. The clubs charged a 10 percent fee to supply the soldiers with cash -- then billed the full amount to their travel cards as a restaurant charge, the GAO found. ""Are these warriors really fighting terrorism while frolicking in a strip club, or defending our country while wearing a Sumo wrestling suit?"" asked Dasbach. ""Americans who support a bigger defense budget, take note: The Pentagon frequently behaves like any other bloated, reckless government agency. It promises your money will be spent on the worthiest of causes, then squanders it on things you could never even imagine."" Other spending uncovered by the audit included $45,000 for luxury cruises, $1,800 for executive pillows, and $24,000 for a sofa and armchair at a military installation in the Middle East, Dasbach noted. Some military employees actually defended the purchases, the audit noted, by saying that recreational items such as golf memberships can be ""a useful tool for building good relations with a host country"" such as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates. Not surprisingly, Dasbach said, the audit found ""little evidence of documented disciplinary action"" against those who misused the cards, so taxpayers may end up paying the tab. ""It's time to impose a little military discipline on these deadbeat Defense Department workers, and force them to personally reimburse taxpayers for every penny of improper spending,"" he said. ""Then cut the Pentagon's massive $379 billion budget to help guard against such wasteful spending in the future. Perhaps that's one way to force the Pentagon to spend its resources defending the country, instead of offending the taxpayer."" -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

preventive delay. ACKs are delayed (per flow) in such a way that WAN-bound traffic reaching
the edge router's Ethernet interface does not exceed WAN link speed (NO
ROUTER QUEUES!). It does not wait for the link to be at or near saturation
to act -- that is why, unlike queueing, it is predictive and not reactive. It slows down the rate of transmission of sending hosts (on a per-flow
basis) to accommodate WAN link speed limit and current network utilization,
rather than fill up queues at LAN speeds and empty them at WAN speeds,
eventually dropping the excess once the queue(s) fill up, informing hosts to
slow down their rate of transmission once queues are beyond a fixed
threshold (90%?). Rate control works equally well for outbound and inbound traffic. Ever heard
of an effective queueing technology for inbound traffic? Queueing packets
after they have crossed a congested link does not make much sense, does it? Re: IPsec/GRE or other encapsulated traffic It obviously cannot dissect IPsec/GRE or other encapsulated traffic: it sees
the tunnel as one connection if the tunneling device is before the PS on the
LAN side (VPN gateway and router are two separate devices, PS between them).
If the router does the tunneling, then the PS sees clear traffic. Typically,
in an organization the first scenario would be the case at headquarters and
the second at branch offices. The PS at the branch sees traffic inside the
tunnel whereas the unit at HQ sees all traffic as one tunnel which allows
full management of both tunneled and clear traffic at both ends. UDP and asymmetrical TCP (where the PS and router only see the outgoing
packet, return traffic coming back through a satellite downlink to a station
on the LAN) are handled differently. For asymmetrical TCP, it will time the release of packets to the receiving
device, thereby indirectly timing the release of acknowledgements by the
receiving host. This informs the sender's TCP/IP stack that it should slow
the release of packets because limited bandwidth is available. For UDP, it utilizes flow-based derivative random drop. It selectively drops
only one packet at a time from flows that are predicted to cause congestion,
which prevents heavy retransmissions and application timeouts. ICMP packets exceeding policy limits are dropped. >_Maybe_ you can do a special case for TCP and try to offload some of the
queueing on
> the endpoints, but I really don't see the real gain in that. The real gain is manageability and control. A LAN host only knows about the
state of its own connections and is oblivious to WAN conditions until its
TCP/IP stack learns (when router queues are nearly full) that the WAN is
congested. A PS will predict and inform the LAN hosts' TCP/IP stacks of the
""speed limit to obey"" for every connection (based on policies and network
conditions), avoiding congestion. Control for asymmetrical TCP and UDP may
not be as ""tight"" as for symmetrical TCP, but it does work. Queueing is akin to deploying cops only when traffic jams occur, vs. rate
control where cops are permanently deployed throughout town, communicating
with each other and with a central control point, predicting upcoming
congestion and regulating traffic, ensuring a smooth flow of traffic. If
there is potential for congestion, it will take a driver a hell of lot
longer to cross town with first approach than it will with the second. Do
you agree? ----- Original Message -----

accurate sales pitch. Let's ponder this for a minute. The device works by delaying ACKs... that is: packets with the ACK
flag set, right? ... [letting this sink in for a while] ... Yes, all packets in an established TCP connection have the ACK flag set.
So all packets except SYNs are candidates for delay when traffic limits
are exceeded? Whoops. Okay, let's assume for a second that the packets aren't actually delayed,
but that the ACK sequence numbers or TCP window size fields are re-written
(dicey). All you've accomplished is move the queueing (delaying) from
the traffic shaper to the endpoints. You still get L7-to-L7 delays. Big
deal if it happens on the wire or in the stack. Also, convincing endpoints
to do delays probably results in less-than-perfect shaping since stack
retransmit timings suddenly affect the actual bandwidth available rather
than having the shaper itself do it; the shaper knows exactly when there
is bandwidth available. But this doesn't even begin to touch on other protocols like UDP or
ICMP. Or, for that matter, IPsec/GRE/whatever tunneled traffic.
Neither of them have sequence numbers or window sizes that you can
manipulate. So, I'm forced to conclude that the PacketShaper either sucks in a major
way, or that your explanation/the explanation that you have been given of
it is wrong. (Sorry.) What I think happens is that the delay is Subject: FW: disable some sites

Iff it starts being a problem, consider it. Right now, John's
right - this remove thread is taking more time than any remove
requests have in the entire past year. One thing you may want to consider (if feasible) - BugTraq's
adopted a technique by which they add headers to each message
indicating where to email to remove. The catch: the mail is
not sent to ""majordomo"" - it is sent to ""listname-remove""@domain.
I've found that useful when I can't remember exactly which mail
addr I used to signup (since my email addr never shows up in
a received message, and I have multiple addresses going to the
same box). For all that, remember, even if you put the actual removal
instructions right in the bottom of your email, you will
_still_ get the clueless asking you how to remove. (Trust me,
we've been there.) Thomas -

"""David&TomGardner@fooladvisor.com""<Subscriber@fooladvisor.com>",Cash Flow Doesn't Lie...Even After Today's Rally ,"You are receiving this email because you signed up to receive one of our free reports. If you would prefer not to receive messages of this type, please unsubscribe by following the instructions at the bottom of this message. Dear Fool, Just before Enron plunged... ...16 of 17 Wall Street analysts were still urging you to buy Enron's stock. While the company piled up debt and manufactured imaginary earnings, auditors gave the balance sheet a big thumbs-up. As investors lost everything, Enron insiders pocketed millions. AND THAT should make every investor's blood boil! Frankly, the Enrons and Global Crossings of the world infuriate me. All the backroom manipulations dirty dealing and cover-ups really make it hard to know who you can trust. And that is why we've created a NEW investing service, ""David & Tom Gardner's Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" -- to bring the Motley Fool co-founders' extraordinary commitment to honest stock analysis, fair dealing and complete disclosure to investors like you on a regular and timely basis. The Motley Fool, which David and Tom founded back in 1993, is dedicated to the principle that given the right tools...the average guy can find great success in every aspect of his financial life. And now, David and Tom are applying this principle -- and their extensive investing experience -- to the new ""Motley Fool Stock Advisor."" But as you'll see, this service isn't just about ""buying more stocks."" OUR GOAL in publishing the ""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" is twofold: To help you gain the knowledge, confidence and resolve to make money in the U.S. stock market...while avoiding the biggest mistakes, as well. The Wall Street analysts touting Global Crossing said its worldwide fiber-optics network would make it the king of telecom. Now these shares are WORTH NOTHING. Microstrategy was the poster child of the technology bubble-after earnings restatements, the stock now sits 99% OFF its high! Kmart's lousy inventory management and marketing incompetence helped drive the company into BANKRUPTCY. WHAT ABOUT Nortel and Lucent-two of America's most widely owned stocks. Will they ever come back? How about AOL? Does its merger with Time-Warner mean the GLORY DAYS are over -- or have they just begun? Are 90% of all telecommunications companies truly in danger of disappearing? If so, which will survive? Will great old names like JP Morgan, Disney and Motorola recover? Well, those are the sorts of questions David & Tom Gardner can help you answer at the ""Motley Fool Stock Advisor."" As they say, ""Show us the money."" When it comes to making promises, fast-talkers can fudge just about anything. But CASH FLOW doesn't lie. YOU CAN avoid a lot of big mistakes by simply making sure a company has the cash coming in to pay its bills. And watching cash flow is also one of the best ways to identify superstar companies -- far more reliable than ""earnings"" that can be manipulated 8 ways to Sunday. Once you eliminate big losers from the equation -- and target the true superstars -- you'll find investing more fun...less stressful...and much more profitable, as well. So forget about Wall Street's ""damaged goods""-
companies that have a boatload of debt and accounting woes, as well. Keep it SIMPLE instead. ""Simple"" means investing in companies that we all -- with a little effort -- can understand. Companies where we know what businesses they're really in. Companies where the financial statements actually mean something. And companies easily recognizable as the ""best of breed."" In the free report you received, ""The One Stock That Keeps Wall Street BUZZING,"" you read about one of David & Tom's very favorite investments: Starbucks. Before this company came along, most folks just took coffee for granted. And certainly, no one proposed any far-reaching business model built around it. Yet these innovators took a low-margin commodity and built a near $3 BILLION company with more than 5000 retail outfits all around the world. Starbucks has been able to open new outlets based on money it has earned from existing ones. That is an astounding testament to its economic power. At The Motley Fool Stock Advisor we'll help you find and truly understand the great investments, the companies with solid balance sheets and real growth prospects. Right now we're following companies such as: *America's most prestigious jeweler -- its brand name has no rival. With net margins of 59% on sales of $1.6 Billion, this company is a great pick for solid returns with low risk. *This software company commands more than 25% of the video game market. Its shares have returned 6,000% since its public debut in 1989. An investment of $5,000 in 1989 is now worth over $300,000. The video game market is expected to double by 2005 with this company enjoying the lion's share of the growth. *This premier credit rating company has locked-in demand for its reports on the creditworthiness of borrowers holding $30 trillion of the world's debt. It has a 20-year record of consistent sales and income growth and is poised for another stellar year. YOU CAN TRY the ""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" for six full months 100% RISK-FREE. If we don't prove its worth to you, it doesn't cost you a dime. As a Charter Subscriber, you get the ""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" delivered to your home each month; a monthly, between-issue, e-mail Fool Flash to help you take full advantage of breaking news; full use of the Motley Fool Stock Advisor subscriber-only Web site, featuring current & back newsletter issues...full updates on all selected stocks...Q & A...and more; plus introductory Special Reports exclusively for new subscribers. To join RISK-FREE, as a Charter Subscriber to ""David & Tom Gardner's Motley Fool Stock Advisor,"" simply click here now:
http://www.ppi-orders.com/index.htm?promo_code=1UE733 Sincerely yours, Mike Bell, Publisher
""David & Tom Gardner's Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" P.S. Do you like BIG PROFITS? In 1994, investment pros sniffed at America Online's high-flying stock and screamed, ""Overvalued."" But the Gardners saw three things they overlooked: 1) AOL was building the premier stop in cyberspace; 2) They had a great retention strategy; and 3) Millions of members paying $$$ every month. So Tom and David bought it. And today they're sitting on whopping 4,120% gains. So you see, while they do structure their investing strategy to avoid big blunders...they do make a lot of money, too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------- * EFF Submits Letter to FCC Chairman Regarding BPDG Proposal The Honorable Michael K. Powell Chairman Federal Communications
Commission 445 12th Street, S.W. Suite 8C453 Washington, DC 20554 BY FACSIMILE, ELECTRONIC MAIL, AND POSTAL MAIL Dear Chairman Powell: I am writing to you today in regards to the digital television
Broadcast Flag; specifically, I write in response to Sen. Hollings'
and Representatives Dingell and Tauzin's letters of July 19, which
urged you to mandate the Broadcast Flag proposal outlined in the
final report of the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a donor-supported
non-profit organization that works to uphold civil liberties
interests in technology policy and law. EFF has played a critical
role in safeguarding crucial freedoms related to computers, the
Internet and consumer electronics devices, defeating the restriction
on strong cryptography exports; securing the legal principle that
Internet wiretaps must only proceed in conjunction with a warrant;
and defending academics, researchers and commercial interests
against DMCA-related prosecution. EFF was an active participant in the Broadcast Protection Discussion
Group. We attended the group's meetings and conference calls and
participated in the group's policy and technical mailing-lists. EFF
also maintains a web-site that was and is the only public source of
information on the Broadcast Flag negotiations and proposal. The
site can be found at http://bpdg.blogs.eff.org. EFF devoted
thousands of staff-hours to publicizing the existence and nature of
the BPDG to the public, to civil liberties and consumer-advocacy
groups, and to entrepreneurial companies and software authors whose
products were threatened by the proceedings. When you and I met at Esther Dyson's PC Forum last March, we spoke
briefly about the civil liberties interests that would be undermined
by the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group's mandate. The BPDG
proposal will have grave consequences for innovation, free
expression, competition and consumer interests. Worst of all, it
will add unnecessary complexity and expense to the DTV transition,
compromising DTV adoption itself. As you are aware, technologists have traditionally manufactured
those devices they believed would be successful in the market, often
in spite of the misgivings of rights-holders. From the piano roll to
the PVR, technologists have enjoyed the freedom to ship whatever
products they believe the public will pay for; what's more,
innovation has always thrived best where there were the fewest
regulatory hurdles. NTSC tuners and devices are governed by precious
few regulations, and consequently we see a rich field of products
that interact with them, from the VCR Plus to tuner-cards for PCs to
the PVR. The Broadcast Flag proposal would limit technologists to
shipping those products that met with the approval of MPAA member
companies. No entrepreneur or software author will know, a priori,
whether his innovative DTV product will be legal in the market until
he has gone to the expense of building it and taking it around to
the Hollywood studios for review. Consumers and industry alike have benefitted greatly from the ""Open
Source"" or ""Free Software"" movement, in which technologies are
distributed in a form that encourages end-user modification. From
server-software like the web-wide success-story apache, to operating
systems like GNU/Linux, to consumer applications like the Mozilla
browser, Free Software is a powerful force for innovation, consumer
benefit and commercial activity. The BPDG proposal implicitly bans
Free Software DTV applications -- such as the DScaler de-interlacer
and the GNU Radio software-defined radio program -- as these
applications are built to be modified by end-users, something that
is banned under the BPDG proposal. The tamper-resistance component
of the BPDG's ""Robustness Requirements"" will create and entire class
of illegal software applications, abridging the traditional First
Amendment freedom enjoyed by software authors who create expressive
speech in code form under one of several Free Software/Open Source
licenses. The BPDG nominally set out to create an objective standard, a bright
line that technologists could hew to in order to avoid liability
when deploying their products. However, the end product of the BPDG
was a ""standard"" that contained no objective criteria for legal
technology; rather, the standard required that new technologies be
approved by MPAA member companies. Not uncoincidentally, the only
technologies that were approved by the MPAA -- and hence the only
legal technologies -- were those produced by the 4C and 5C
consortia, a group of technology companies that acted as the MPAA's
allies throughout the BPDG process. This is an harbinger of the sort
of regime that the BPDG standard will usher in: technology companies
will be able to shut their competitors out of the marketplace by
allying themselves with Hollywood, brokering deals to allow certain
technologies and outlaw others. The marketplace is a proven mechanism for rapidly and efficiently
producing products that increase the value and desirability of new
technologies, such as DTV. A BPDG mandate would subvert the market
for DTV innovation. Competing companies with lower-cost DTV
technology alternatives would be restrained from bringing these to
market if they failed to assuage the MPAA's concerns about
unauthorized redistribution. Furthermore, the universe of
unauthorized-but-lawful uses for DTV programming will be shrunk down
to the much smaller space of explicitly authorized uses. The ability
of the public to make unauthorized-but-lawful uses of television
programming has been an historical force for increasing the value of
broadcast programming, from the VCR to the PVR. Ironically, the inevitable damage that a Broadcast Flag mandate
would do to innovation, competition and consumer interests can only
slow down DTV adoption, by driving up the cost of DTV devices while
reducing the number of desirable features that an open market would
create. If the public is offered less functionality for more money,
they will not flock to DTV. The most disheartening thing about the Broadcast Flag is that there
is neither a strong case that the Broadcast Flag is a necessary tool
for protecting copyright, nor that the Broadcast Flag would be
effective in that role. The existing practice of Internet
infringement of broadcast programming -- analog captures from
devices that satisfy the requirements of the BPDG proposal -- would
not be stopped by the presence of a Broadcast Flag.
Higher-resolution DTV signals will likewise present no challenge to
determined infringers, who can capture full-quality analog signal
from DTV devices and then re-digitize them, suffering only a single
generation's worth of loss-of-quality before the programming enters
the Internet. Meanwhile, the underlying rubric for a Broadcast Flag -- that
infringement will undermine Hollywood's business to the point that
movies will no longer be available to the public, reducing the value
of DTV -- is no more than superstition. No credible study or
analysis, undertaken by a neutral party, has ever been presented to
Congress, the FCC, the CPTWG or the BPDG supporting this notion. The
public is being asked to sacrifice its rights in copyright; industry
is being asked to place its right to innovation in the hands of
entertainers; the US government is being asked to mandate
extraordinary, unprecedented regulation of the $600 billion
technology sector -- all on the uncorroborated opinions of a few
studio executives. EFF welcomes the FCC's oversight of the Broadcast Flag issue. The
BPDG proceedings took place behind a shroud of secrecy, in a
looking-glass ""public process"" where only those participants the
organizers wanted to hear from were made privy to its existence,
where the co-chairs invented rules and processes on the fly to suit
the needs of the entertainment interests and the technology
companies that had privately secured a promise of a legal monopoly
for their products, where the press was banned. The FCC has an admirable tradition of seeking and weighing public
opinion in its proceedings. As the FCC considers the Broadcast Flag,
EFF hopes that it will start anew, setting aside the findings of the
BPDG in light of the concerns raised by Microsoft, Philips, Sharp,
Thomson, and Zenith, as well as non-profit organizations including
EFF, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, the Free
Software Foundation, Public Knowledge, digitalconsumer.org, the
Center for Democracy in Technology, and the Computer and
Communications Industry Association. Thank you for attention in this matter. Please let me know if we can
be of any further assistance to you. Sincerely yours, Cory Doctorow for the Electronic Frontier Foundation Links: EFF's BPDG Blog: http://bpdg.blogs.eff.org An overview of our concerns with the broadcast flag:

Hamidi is now on appeal to the California Supreme
Court. EFF filed an amicus brief in support of Ken Hamidi on Aug. 6,
2002. The facts are simple: Over about two years, Hamidi on six
occasions sent e-mail critical of Intel's employment practices to
between 8,000 and 35,000 Intel employees. Intel demanded that Hamidi
stop, but he refused. Intel obtained an injunction barring Hamidi
from e-mailing Intel employees at their Intel e-mail addresses,
based on the common-law tort of ""trespass to chattels."" (""Chattel""
is a legal term that refers to personal property, as opposed to
property in land.) EFF's amicus brief argues three main points. (1) Intel did not qualify for relief under ""trespass to chattels""
because Intel's e-mail servers were not themselves harmed by
Hamidi's e-mails. If Intel was harmed, it was because the content of
Hamidi's e-mails affected Intel employees, not because sending the
e-mails affected the functioning of Intel's servers. (2) By focusing on unwanted ""contact"" with the chattel and ignoring
the harm requirement, the court of appeal turned ""trespass to
chattels"" into a doctrine that threatens common Internet activity
like search engines and linking. For example, if a website posted a
""no trespassing"" sign, any ""contact"" by a search engine could be
considered a trespass even if it caused no harm. (3) The court of appeal wrongly held that the injunction did not
infringe Hamidi's freedom of speech. The First Amendment limits
private parties' legal remedies in many areas of law, such as libel,
out of concern that private parties will use the law to suppress
criticism. The same principle should apply here, where Intel's
claims of harm stem from the meaning of Hamidi's speech. Links: The Intel v.

controversial DeCSS software, has been pushed back again. It is now
scheduled to be heard on December 9, 2002, in Oslo, Norway. In the
fall of 1999, Johansen and his team reverse-engineered the content
scrambling system (CSS) software used to encrypt DVDs in an effort
to build a DVD player for the Linux operating system. In January of
2002, the Norwegian Economic Crime Unit (OKOKRIM) charged Johansen
with a violation of Norwegian Criminal Code Section 145.2, which
outlaws breaking into a third-party's property in order to steal
data that one is not entitled to. This prosecution marks the first
time the law will be used to prosecute a person for accessing his
own property (his own DVD). Johansen faces two years in prison if
convicted. The prosecution is based on a formal complaint filed by
the Motion Picture Association. The trial had originally been scheduled to take place in June of 2002 but was rescheduled when the court could not find any qualified judges to hear Johansen's case. Now the case is scheduled to be heard by a three-judge panel.

to announce that former MIT doctoral student Andrew ""Bunnie"" Huang
will present a paper explaining a security flaw in the Microsoft
Xbox (TM) videogame system. Huang will present his paper, ""Keeping Secrets in Hardware: the
Microsoft X-BOX Case Study,"" at 5:25 p.m. PDT on August 13, 2002, at
the 2002 Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems
(CHES 2002) in Redwood City, California (Aug. 13-15, 2002). The Xbox security system is intended to allow people to play only
videogames authorized by Microsoft. Huang's paper ""shows how a
person could defeat that system with a small hardware investment,""
said MIT Professor Hal Abelson, one of Huang's advisors. ""More
importantly, the paper relates the security vulnerability to a
general design flaw shared by other high-profile security systems
such as the government's Clipper Chip and the movie industry's
Contents Scrambling System (CSS) for DVD players."" Huang contacted EFF in March after his advisors told him that his
preliminary findings raised potentially significant legal questions.
With the help of Boston College law professor Joe Liu, EFF worked
with Huang, Abelson, and MIT administrators to analyze the legal
issues and draft letters notifying Microsoft of Huang's research
findings and intended publication, one of the steps encouraged by
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Microsoft told Huang and Abelson that while it might prefer that the
paper not be published, it would be inappropriate to ask MIT to
withhold the paper. ""Microsoft deserves praise for making no attempt to control
publication,"" said Abelson. ""Their response shows that they value
academic freedom, and that they appreciate the critical role of
unfettered research and publication in advancing technology."" Other companies have reacted otherwise, using the DMCA to threaten
researchers. The Recording Industry Association of America last year
warned Princeton Professor Edward Felten after his research team
exposed weaknesses in digital music security technologies. Last
month, Hewlett Packard (HP) threatened research collective SnoSoft
over exposing a security vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix operating
system. Soon after, HP clarified that it would not use the DMCA to
stifle research or impede the flow of information that would improve
computer security. Huang said that while he is glad he can openly present his paper,
""The DMCA clearly had a chilling effect on my work. I was afraid to
submit my research for peer review until after the EFF's efforts to
clear potential legal restraints."" ""Researchers should be analyzing security, not worrying about
getting sued,"" said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Lee Tien. Links: For this release:

edition of *War of Honor,* the latest volume in David Weber's epic
Honor Harrington space-opera. The CD will contain at least 22
complete novels, all in open formats like html and RTF, with the
fair-use-friendly admonishment ""This disk and its contents may be
copied and shared but NOT sold."" Included on the disk are the entire
Honor Harrington series to date, as well as other titles from the
Baen line, including Keith Laumer's *Retief!* and Larry Niven and
Jerry Pournelle's *Fallen Angels*. Baen has been a banner-carrier for fair-use in electronic
publishing, shipping text and html files that can be played on a
multitude of devices. Other publishers have chosen to publish their
material in copy-controlled formats that make it impossible to
legally loan or resell the titles you purchase, are locked to a
specific device, can't play on every operating system, and
occasionally lock out assistive technology like the screen-readers
employed by the blind. Dmitry Skylarov, a Russian scientist, was arrested in July 2001, for
demonstrating how end-users could defeat the copy-prevention
employed by Adobe's e-book technology. Adobe asked the FBI to arrest
Skylarov for violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA),
which makes it a crime to describe techniques for circumventing
copy-prevention technology. Though Skylarov was later released, his
employer, ElcomSoft, is still facing charges in the USA, and the
Russian government has issued an advisory warning Russian scientists
to steer clear of American technical conferences until the DMCA is
repealed. Here is Baen's statement on the CD release: You are about to start playing with a CD-ROM that has fairly
extraordinary content. As of this writing it includes twenty-two
UNENCRYPTED novels in several formats, the ten Honor Harrington
Novels, 3 Honor Harrington Anthologies and 9 novels by friends of
Honor, and by the time of distribution it may well contain more.
(More than twenty novels for free, and with no stupid codes to work
around. Think of that.) The reason for the plethora of formats is to
try to please the people who want to read the novels on their Palm
Pilots or other text-specialized palm-sized devices. Links: Baen Books's page for *War of Honor*:

Caymanian Customs Wonder Dog at extreme close range, or heard the
story about the expat's college age kid, actually born on Cayman, who
was literally exiled from the island when the island constabulary
""discovered"" a marijuana seed or three in his summer-break rental car
a few years back. I mean, his old man was some senior cheese at Global Crossing at the
time, but this was back when they could do no wrong. If that's what
they did to *his* kid, imagine what some poor former
junk-bond-hustler might have to deal with someday for, say, the odd
unauthorized Cuban nightlife excursion. A discretely folded twenty
keeps the stamp off your passport on the ground in Havana, and a
bottle of Maker's Mark goes a long way towards some interesting
nocturnal diversion when you get there and all, but still, you can't
help thinking that Uncle's going to come a-knockin', and that Cayman
van's going to stop rockin' some day, and when it does, it ain't
gonna be pretty. Closer to home, conceptually at least, a couple of cryptogeeken were
hustled off and strip-searched, on the spot, when they landed on
Grand Cayman for the Financial Cryptography conference there a couple
of years ago. Like lots of cypherpunks, these guys were active
shooters in the Bay Area, and they had stopped in Jamaica, Mon, for a
few days on the way to Grand Cayman. Because they, and their stuff,
reeked on both counts, they were given complementary colorectal
examinations and an entertaining game of 20 questions, or two,
courtesy of the Caymanian Federales, after the obligatory fun and
games with a then-snarling Crotch-Sniffing Caymanian Wonder Dog.
Heck, I had to completely unpack *all* my stuff for a nice, well-fed
Caymanian customs lady just to get *out* of the country when I left. Besides, tax havens are being increasingly constrained as to their
activities these days, because they cost the larger nation-states too
much in the way of ""escaped"" ""revenue"", or at least the perception of
same in the local ""free"" press. Obviously, if your money ""there""
isn't exchangeable into your money ""here"", it kind of defeats the
purpose of keeping your money ""there"" in the first place, giving
folks like FinCEN lots of leverage when financial treaties come up
for renegotiation due to changes in technology, like on-line
credit-card and securities clearing, or the odd governmental or
quango re-org, like they are wont to do increasingly in the EU, and
the US. As a result, the veil of secrecy went in Switzerland quite a while
ago. The recent holocaust deposit thing was just the bride and groom
on that particular wedding-cake, and, as goes Switzerland, so goes
Luxembourg, and of course Lichtenstein, which itself is usually
accessible only through Switzerland. Finally, of course, the Caymans
themselves will cough up depositor lists whenever Uncle comes calling
about one thing or another on an increasingly longer list of fishing
pretexts. At this point, the ""legal"", state-backed pecuniary privacy pickings
are kind of thin on the ground. I mean, I'm not sure I'd like to keep
my money in, say, Vanuatu. Would you? Remember, this is a place where
a bandana hanging on a string across an otherwise public road will
close it down until the local erst-cannibal hunter-gatherer turned
statutorily-permanent landowner figures out just what his new or
imagined property rights are this afternoon. The point is, any cypherpunk worth his salt will tell you that only
solution to financial or any other, privacy, is to make private
transactions on the net, cheaper, and more secure, than ""transparent""
transactions currently are in meatspace. Then things get *real*
interesting, and financial privacy -- and considerably more personal
freedom -- will just be the icing on the wedding cake. Bride and
groom action figures sold separately, of course. Cheers,
RAH
(Who went to FC2K at the Grand Cayman Marriott in February that year.
Nice place, I liked Anguilla better though, at least at the time, and
I haven't been back to either since. The beaches are certainly better
in Anguilla, and the ""private"" banking system there is probably just
as porous as Cayman's is, by this point. If I were to pick up and
move Somewhere Free outside Your Friendly Neighborhood Unipolar
Superpower, New Zealand is somewhere near the top of my list, and
Chile would be next, though things change quickly out there in
ballistic-missile flyover country. In that vein, who knows, maybe
we're in for some kind of latter-day Peloponnesian irony, and
*Russia* will end up the freest place on earth someday. Stranger
things have happened in the last couple of decades, yes?) -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

I came across the Into Archaeology website this week; it's worth a look for a number of reasons, but in particular its articles section
has some good stuff (currently, an interview with Adrienne Mayor, a
piece
on the Thera ships, and a piece on the work at Bird Cove): http://www.intoarch.com/ The Oriental Institute has recently added a whole pile of publically-
accessible articles to its News and Notes section: http://www-oi.uchicago.edu/OI/DEPT/PUB/NewsAndNotes.html

"""Vincent Chin"" <nukiez@hotmail.com>",,"Ripped from http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Linux.Wireless.usage.html "" 11 Access Points, Home Gateways and Ethernet bridging
Most Access Points act as a MAC level bridge, allowing the Wireless LAN to be a natural extension of a wired network. They are deployed in a cellular fashion, and provide extended security, management and roaming.
On the other hand, the Home Gateways allow a single cell to be connected to a WAN, like a modem, a cable modem or a DSL access. The set of features is quite different, and they offer NAT/masquerading and PPP configuration. The conventional Ethernet bridging method (promiscuous sniffing) doesn't work with most wireless LAN standard, because of the header encapsulation and the interactions with link layer retransmissions. In other word, most often, when you use a software bridge on a wireless LAN (such as the Linux bridge on a 802.11 card), it doesn't work (moreover, quite often promiscuous is broken as well). "" [[ What the?? What is he talking about?? Aren't we all using Linux to bridge our networks? ]] "" The driver could work around this restriction by creating its own MAC headers (802.11 headers instead of 802.3, and putting the right bits in the right place), but in fact most vendors don't provide the specification on how to this with their hardware (when they don't explicitely prevent it in hardware, to force you to buy their Access Points). In other words, don't expect to use your Linux PC as a wireless bridge or wireless Access Points with most products out there, and forget about turning it into an Access Point. Of course, there is some exceptions. "" [[ Is this true? ]] "" The workaround is to set the wireless LAN in ad-hoc mode and to use other methods, such as routing, masquerading, IP bridging, ARP proxying... "" [[ Yes, I am in a process of building a wireless-lan wired-lan bridge. But I don't understand what this guy is talking about. Anyone? Vince. ]] _________________________________________________________________

4. WORK FOR SOURCEFORGE.NET
5. SITE STATISTICS 0. INTRO Hello SourceForge.net Users, This week we've made a big announcement. As you likely know, any
large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to
the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you.
These databases manage everything from user authentication, session
management, site searching, etc. SourceForge.net is a database-
dependent website. Today we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2,
a powerful relational database by IBM. We are doing this because
the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and
70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this
growth. We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us
the resources to make this transition successful. You can read the
press release here: http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.html How will this effect you? In the first phase, you won't see much
difference other then the site will continue to grow and the
SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth. In later
phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of
the databases advanced capabilities. Today our mail archives have been converted over. The rest of the
site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months. If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site,
please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net. I always
appreciate the feedback. Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the
Open Source Community. Pat- Patrick McGovern
Director, SourceForge.net 1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITY SourceForge.net continues to grow, and it's appetite for bandwidth
is never-ending. Every day SF.NET serves over 300,000 files to
ensure that developers and end-users within the Open Source
community can always obtain the software released by hosted
projects, SourceForge.net maintains a network of high-capacity
download servers. These servers are located throughout the world,
as to provide better download times regardless of which network
provider you are using, and regardless of your geographic location. Three new download servers have recently been added to our network,
further strengthening our file serving capabilities. These latest
additions include servers hosted by: Time Warner Telecom (Wisconsin,USA);
http://www.twtelecom.com/ University of Minnesota (Minnesota, USA)
http://www.umn.edu/ CESNET (Czech Republic)
http://www.cesnet.cz/ We thank these sponsors for their commitment to SourceForge.net and
the needs of the Open Source community. On a related note, we are looking for a mirror in Japan. If you are
an ISP or University in Japan and are willing to spare 20Mbps for a
SourceForge.net mirror (we'll supply the hardware), please let us
know at bandwidth@sourceforge.net 2. AUDIO OF KERNEL SUMMIT AVAILABLE SourceForge.net now has the audio from the entire 2002 OSDN/USENIX
Kernel Summit, held in June. Listen to the Linux kernel master
discuss such hot topics as kernel modules, virtual memory,
block I/O, database scaling, security modules, and async I/O.

foundry guide? Go to http://foundries.sourceforge.net/; find a
topic that interests you; and send email to
foundries@sourceforge.net stating your desired topic and why you
are qualified to be a foundry guide. 4. WORK FOR SOURCEFORGE.NET We have a new position for a senior web developer available at

replies that look like this: ""Hey!! I didn't subscribe to this list!!!
You spammer. I hate you! I hate your dog! (insert other colorful
phrases here)"". The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net
there was a check box that said ""Receive Site-wide updates, low
volume"". You left it checked when you submitted the registration form,
hence you are receiving this email. We send these updates every 4 to 6
weeks, so it truly is low volume. However if you want off, this is not
a problem. Simply click on the link below. ==================================================================

West Virginia's Diane Stratton recommended NNT to some friends and is now enjoying QuicKeys 2.0, a great Windows management software package. Diane is our latest winner and you could be next. Just go to the NNT Web site at http://www.NeatNetTricks.com and click on ""Recommend NNT."" Nothing could be easier. . . . . . 04. MOUSELESS WAY HOME. To go home quickly in Internet Explorer, touch F6 to highlight the Address Bar and type two periods (..) there. The Enter key then takes you home. 05. KARTOO. Search engines are everywhere on the Internet but Kartoo at http://www.kartoo.net is quite unusual. It's a meta search engine that displays results on a map in the form of a ball. The larger the ball, the more relevant the result. As you mouseover each result, site descriptions are revealed. If all that sounds confusing, the explanation is more complicated than the service itself. Just try it. . . . . . You should make it a habit to visit the NNT Store at http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store . We try to have several great products there at a limited-time price much less than anywhere else on the Net. Currently, you'll find excellent ebooks, a very effective popup stopper, and the very useful utility described in item 01 above, along with the usual opportunity to subscribe to NNT Premium and ArchivesExpress. Check us out, you'll be glad you did. . . . . . 06. XP TIME FEATURE. Windows XP added a nice feature that heretofore required a separate software application. It will connect, either at a programmed time or manually, to a time server via the Internet and reset that often erroneous internal clock. Just click on the time in the systems tray, go to Date and Time Properties and click the Internet Time tab. 07. LEAF PEEPER ALERT. A bit early, but soon the changing colors of autumn will begin here in the U.S. For those who like to follow the display, consider http://www.stormfax.com/foliage.htm for a comprehensive collection of links and toll-free numbers to each state to determine peak color times. 08. SAVINGS SCRAPS. Some oldies are worth repeating. If you're working with text in, for example, MS Word or WordPad, and would like a handy way to save a portion for later easy retrieval, just select (highlight) it and click/drag it to your desktop. When the newly created icon is clicked on, it will show the application with which the scrap was created, along with the first few words of the text. A double click opens the text in the application with which it was created. 09. QUICK ACCESS. To go to a frequently used program, you may find yourself drilling down to the desktop and searching out the shortcut icon. Consider instead setting up a key combination that will provide quick access without using the shortcut. Right click on the shortcut and select Properties. In the Shortcut key window, select any key you can remember and click OK. Ctrl+Alt and that key will open the application whenever needed. 10. DON'T BELIEVE YOUR EMAIL. We've been asked about those emails with virus attachments that appear to be coming from NNT, asking for a confirmation of a subscription. Don't believe it, and don't open the attachments. Maybe this exchange between NNT and Lyris (our mail manager) will clear things up: NNT: Is there anything that can be done about the current strains of virus that implant on address books and randomly send email asking alleged subscribers to verify their subscription (when they haven't subscribed at all)? I've received some of these as well, and I know it's become a widespread problem with other ezine publishers, creating a lot of ill will all around. Is there some configuration that we could change to keep these from going out except to legitimate subscribers? Lyris: Unfortunately, there isn't much we can do about this since it isn't actually ListManager doing the sending. The real problem is that people sometimes will add the ""join"" address to their address book and that is what causes the problems. The best we can do is advise people not to have their address books set to automatically add any email address that they send a message to even once. The main culprit here seems to be Outlook Express.

MACHINIMA My reputation for small errors continues to grow (I am
keeping quiet about the big ones) with a misprint in last week's
piece on this word. In the sentence giving the etymology, of all
places, I misspelled it ""mechanima"", thus confusing everybody. APPETITE OVER TIN CUP Several replies came in about this saying,
confirming that variations on it and other ways of saying ""head
over heels"" are widely known, especially ""ass over appetite"" from
the US, where ""appetite"" may be a transferred term for the mouth.
But the specific form that Maria Jessup Robinson was asking about,
""appetite over tin cup"", seems not to be known much at all. It
would seem to be a conflation of the British expression ""arse over
teakettle"" and the American ""ass over appetite"" (note my deliberate
use of the two spellings of ""arse"" here!). The saying was probably
modified because at the time it was created a tea kettle was an
item less common in America than in Britain. Even in Britain these
days it is obsolete as a fixed term except within this expression,
which itself is now not very common. BUMBERSHOOT Several subscribers have pointed out that the word is
in the lyric of a song sung by Dick Van Dyke in the film ""Chitty
Chitty Bang Bang"": Me ol' bam-boo, me ol' bam-boo You'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo You can have me hat or me bumbershoot But you'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo It may be one reason why some Americans, not familiar with the word
in their own country, have come to believe it must be British. OLOGIES AND ISMS The publication date of my book has been moved
back a week in the UK to 29 August. A review by Jonathon Green is
scheduled for the issue of 31 August (assuming nobody changes the
date again). See for
more details and UK ordering information. 2. Turns of Phrase: Asian Brown Cloud
-------------------------------------------------------------------
As though we didn't have enough to worry about weather-wise, what
with global warming, the ozone hole, and the new El Niño season,
UN scientists have now identified this new threat to the world's
climate. It is a cloud of smog three kilometres deep, enveloping
the whole of southern Asia - a soup of industrial pollutants,
carbon monoxide from vehicle exhausts and particles of soot from
burning forests and millions of rural cooking fires. It blocks 15%
of sunlight, which reduces crop yields. It also creates acid rain,
leads to respiratory illnesses, reduces rainfall and causes extreme
weather events. Because the cloud is capable of being dispersed
rapidly around the world, it may affect a much wider area than just
Asia. The term ""Asian Brown Cloud"" seems to have been around for a
couple of years in scientific circles, but came to prominence this
week in a report prepared by a team of international climatologists
at the UN Environment Programme in preparation for the World Summit
on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg next week. The good
news, they say, is that unlike other causes of pollution and
climate change, this one is curable if Asians can shift to more
efficient ways of burning fuels. The ""Asian Brown Cloud,"" a 2-mile-thick blanket of pollution over
South Asia, may be causing the premature deaths of half a million
people in India each year, deadly flooding in some areas and
drought in others, a new U.N.-sponsored study indicates. [""Los Angeles Times"", Aug. 2002] A UN-backed study released on Friday said the ""Asian Brown Cloud"" -
a vast haze of pollution stretching across South Asia - is damaging
agriculture, modifying rainfall patterns and endangering the
population. [""Agence France Presse"", Aug. 2002] 3. Weird Words: Pyknic /'pIknIk/
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Short and fat. Nothing to do with al-fresco meals, though it is said the same way
as ""picnic"". In the early years of the twentieth century the German psychiatrist
Ernst Kretschmer examined criminals to try to tie their physical
shape and constitution to their personalities and mental illnesses.
Tall and thin ones he called ""asthenic"" (or ""leptosomic"") and
considered them to be the sort that commits fraud and petty theft.
A second set were athletic types with well-developed muscles, whom
he concluded, unsurprisingly, were more likely to be violent. The
third sort were the ""pyknic"" ones, who seemed to be a mixture of
the other two kinds so far as their criminal tendencies were
concerned. He took ""pyknic"" from Greek ""puknos"", thick or close-
packed; it appeared first in his book ""Körperbau und Charakter""
(Physique and Character) in 1921, from where it soon moved into
English. The American psychologist William Sheldon built on and modified
Kretschmer's ideas, coming up with the three terms to describe body
types - ""endomorph"", ""mesomorph"" and ""ectomorph"" - that are now
more common. He considered Kretschmer's pyknic type to be a mixture
of the endomorph (with a soft round body tending to put on fat, the
Santa Claus type) and the mesomorph (with a compact, powerful, and
athletic body tending to the Tarzan or Mr Universe type) and came
up with the phrase ""pyknic practical joke"" to describe a person who
is muscular in early life but who later goes pear-shaped and
balloons out into obesity. 4. Q&A
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. A friend and I were reading a recent article in the ""New York
Times"" that made mention of a ""mash note"". I had never heard this
term before, but I extrapolated that it is some sort of love note.
Is there a more specific meaning than a simple love note? And can
you give some insight as to the origin of the term? [Jane
Rosenthal, California] A. You're right about the meaning of the phrase. We have to go back some way to find the origin. The first form was
the word ""mash"" by itself. This was a slang term in the US in the
1870s for an infatuation or crush (a magazine in 1877 defined it as
""a deep but fleeting affection of the heart""). A ""mash"" could also
be a dandy or the object of one's affection (of either sex) or - as
a verb - to make amorous advances to a member of the opposite sex,
to flirt or seduce. A ""masher"" was a man who thought himself
irresistible to the female sex but whose advances were often
unwelcome. The evidence collected by Professor Lighter in the ""Random House
Historical Dictionary of American Slang"" and by others suggests
that it was originally a term used in and around the theatre.
Charles Godfrey Leland (best known for his ""Hans Breitmanns
Ballads"" about a German immigrant) wrote a note above his poem,
""The Masher"", dated about 1895, confirming this: The word to ""mash,"" in the sense of causing love or attracting by a glance or fascinating look, came into ordinary slang from the American stage. Thus an actress was often fined for ""mashing"" or smiling at men in the audience. ""Mash"" and its derivatives crossed the Atlantic to Britain about
1880. ""Masher"" in particular became a term in London society,
especially among the more raffish supper-club and theatre-going
classes, for a type of fashionable male. The Oxford English
Dictionary defines it (with a distinctly maidenly air of drawing
away its collective skirts) as ""a fop of affected manners and
exaggerated style of dress who frequented music-halls and
fashionable promenades and who posed as a 'lady-killer'"", noting
that the word had been common ""in 1882 and for a few years after"".
In a letter from London in the old ""Overland Monthly and Out West
Magazine"" in 1889, a correspondent described a member of an
impoverished theatrical company: ""This dashing youth was distinctly
conscious of his fascinations for the buxom maids who sighed beside
us, and the airy and elegant nonchalance of the glances that
superbly took them in would be a lesson for champion 'mashers' of a
far higher class"". A ""mash note"" (in its first appearances, ""mash letter"") was an
obvious enough extension: a love letter. It is recorded first in
1880 and - as you have discovered - is still doing well. Where ""mash"" and its relatives come from has been a subject of
debate. It is sometimes said that it is from the standard English
word meaning to make soft by one of various means, with its obvious
reference to rendering the object of one's attentions pliable and
yielding. Max Beerbohm, writing in London in 1894 (mashers were
still around then, despite the OED's comment) remarked that some
people derived it from ""Ma Chère"", ""the mode of address used by the
gilded youth to the barmaids of the period"". But he thought it
really came from ""the chorus of a song, which, at that time, had a
great vogue in the music-halls: 'I'm the slashing, dashing, mashing
Montmorency of the day.'"" We're pretty sure now that he was wrong,
but he could hardly know that. Back to Charles Leland again. Apart from his humorous writings, he
also researched and wrote a great deal about the Romany language as
well as Gypsy songs and customs. The following note from the
introduction to the poem gives an origin that is now widely
accepted: It was introduced by the well-known gypsy family of actors, C., among whom Romany was habitually spoken. The word ""masher"" or ""mash"" means in that tongue to allure, delude, or entice. It was doubtless much aided in its popularity by its quasi-identity with the English word. But there can be no doubt as to the gypsy origin of ""mash"" as used on the stage. I am indebted for this information to the late well- known impresario Palmer of New York, and I made a note of it years before the term had become at all popular. Though defunct in British English, ""mash"" and ""masher"" have never
quite gone away in America. ""Mash"" had a resurgence of popularity
as student slang in the 1980s in the sense of necking or petting,
though that may be a back-formation from ""mash note"". 5. Endnote

""A Spanish lady asked an acquaintance during a visit to Ireland
whether there was a word in his language similar to 'manaña'. The
Irishman thought for a moment, then said: 'Sure there is, but it
doesn't have the same sense of urgency.'"" [Traditional Irish joke.] A. Subscription commands

While, following last week's announcement of Ice T's Posse Pops, CRAIG LEFF thought we'd be reassured by the news that NBC are launching their own range of TV-themed Baskin-Robbins ice-creams, including a ""Fear Factor"" flavour designed to recreate the experience of eating ""dirt and spiders"": http://www.adage.com/news.cms?newsId=35520 ... back with confectionery, LEON VERRALL remained unimpressed with STARBURST FRUITINESSE (from 49p, ""tasted of plastic...

EFF is a member-supported nonprofit. Please sign up as a member today! * Judge Grants Consumer Voice in ReplayTV Lawsuit Hollywood Tries to Skip Over Consumers' Concerns Los Angeles - Judge Florence Cooper today granted five ReplayTV owners
a voice in the court debate over their rights to record television
programs and to skip commercials using digital video recorders (DVRs).
The federal court denied the entertainment industry motion to dismiss
the ReplayTV owners' lawsuit and agreed to combine the consumer
lawsuit with an entertainment industry lawsuit filed last fall to ban
ReplayTV DVRs. ""We're pleased the court has recognized that the debate about digital
video recorders must include the customers who purchase and use the
devices,"" said Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Intellectual
Property Attorney Robin Gross. ""[T]he issue of whether the Newmark Plaintiffs' use of the ReplayTV
DVRs' send-show and commercial-skipping features constitutes fair use
will most likely figure prominently in both the ReplayTV action and
the Newmark action,"" wrote Judge Cooper in her opinion. Responding to the entertainment industry's lawsuit against DVR
manufacturers, EFF petitioned the court on behalf of the five ReplayTV
owners to declare legal their use of the digital devices also known as
personal video recorders (PVRs). EFF seeks to ensure that the legal
debate over DVRs will include consumers' concerns along with those of
the entertainment and consumer electronics industries. The entertainment industry claims that commercial skipping infringes
copyright and digital recording aids piracy. ""I'm not a crook if I skip commercials or share a news interview of
myself with my mom using the SendShow feature rather than sending her
a videotape,"" said Craig Newmark, founder of craigslist.org and a
ReplayTV owner. ""I shouldn't have to worry about getting prosecuted,
but the Turner Broadcasting CEO tells us that taking a bathroom break
is criminal. We even have Senators urging Attorney General Ashcroft to
prosecute people who share files."" Along with Newmark, ReplayTV customers filing the lawsuit with legal
representation by the EFF are: Keith Ogden, owner of a financial
broker firm in San Francisco; Shawn Hughes, a small business owner in
Georgia; Seattle journalist Glenn Fleishman; and southern Californian
video engineer Phil Wright. Links: For this release:

Ian today challenged the music industry by celebrating peer-to-peer
(P2P) music sharing as a boon to musicians. Ian, who is in the San Francisco Bay Area as part of her current
concert tour, recently published ""The Internet Debacle,"" a pointed
critique of the music industry's disregard for musicians and consumers
who want to distribute and acquire music online. The Electronic
Frontier Foundation (EFF) applauds Ian's actions and hopes that others
will see the Internet as an aid, not a threat, to musicians. In the article, Ian assails the major record labels' argument that P2P
file-sharing is harming artists. ""Free Internet downloads are good for the music industry and its
artists,"" explains Ian. ""Every act that can't get signed to a major,
for whatever reason, can reach literally millions of new listeners,
enticing them to buy the CD and come to the concerts."" She adds that during the heyday of Napster she saw a marked increase
in CD sales from her website. She attacks technological and political
measures meant to harm consumers by restricting their right to copy
and back up their legally purchased music. Ian will play on August 17 in San Rafael, CA. During her 17 album career, Ian has earned nine Grammy nominations and
three awards. Her best known songs include 1967's ""Society's Child""
and 1975's ""At Seventeen."" More recently, her 1993 album ""Breaking
Silence"" was nominated for a Grammy Award as Contemporary Folk Album
of the Year. Her songs have been recorded by artists ranging from
Bette Midler to Cher, from Glen Campbell to Vanilla Fudge, and from
Joan Baez to Etta James.

arguments about whether a California court has jurisdiction over
Matthew Pavlovich, an Indiana college student who is a resident of
Texas, for his hosting of an Internet mailing list. Pavlovich
maintained the mailing list for the LiVid programming group, which
provides a unified development and user resource center for video and
DVD-related work for the Linux operating system. One of the group's
projects was to create a DVD player for computer systems that run
Linux. As part of that effort, DeCSS, a program that decrypts the copy
protection on DVDs, was published on the group's mailing list. The
entertainment industry has sued Pavlovich in California court, and
last year a California appellate court ruled Pavlovich was within the
state court's jurisdiction since he published information that relates
to the entertainment industry, which is based in California. EFF and Pavlovich's legal team argue that Pavlovich is outside of
California's jurisdiction since he was a college student in Indiana
with no contacts to California when DeCSS was published on the LiVid
list. The hearing on September 5 will take place in San Francisco.

Lifetimetv.com community member BELFAST BELLE writes:
""My belief is that I started using drugs to fit in and to cope with things that happened to me. My mom died when I was 10. I had to live away from my dad and brothers. Where I grew up I was sexually abused for years, but I didn't dare tell anyone. When I finally went to live with my dad and brothers, I had no self-esteem left. I experienced so much shame, and in my mind it seemed as if everyone knew what happened. Drugs helped me to feel OK and like I was a part of something. When my dad died, I was devastated. It threw me into a full-blown addiction. My drug use landed me in rehab, in debt and in strained relationships with my brothers. Thanks to the help of Narcotics Anonymous, I have been clean since December 28, 1991. I now have great relationships with my siblings. I love them more than they will ever know. I also have a beautiful seven-year-old daughter who has never seen her mother touch drugs. I don't have any desire to use, either -- just the desire to be the best pe rson I can be.""

When I was in Omaha a couple of weeks ago, I made the unfortunate mistake of driving through the intersection of 90th and Dodge. Those of you in Omaha know what sorts of things I was muttering under my breath during the ordeal. Is it possible to suffer from road rage when you're not moving? Omaha has started a The route to Des Moines from Waterloo isn't much better right now as they widen highway 330/65 to 4 lane between Marshalltown and Des Moines. Once that's done, it will cut 20-30 minutes from the trip, and judging from the progress they've been making, it won't be too much longer.

Iomega Intros 750MB Zip http://www.iomega.com/ziphttp://www.iomega.com/zip I've all but ditched Zip drive use entirely due to cost and small capacity. I know many people that still use Zip drives, and I still play with a 1GB Jaz drive from time to time, but with the ease and low cost of CD-RW drives and media, Zip just hasn't stood a chance. Now that Iomega has bumped the capacity to 750MB, employed USB 2.0 and pushed the speed of the drives significantly higher, maybe it's still worth a look for those that need a fast removable media option. I'll stick with CD-RW myself. I'll sacrifice some speed for the reliability of optical media. But that's just me.

Common sense has finally won, with the developers delivering many more command line tools to manage core services. Of course, this isn't the only thing being brought to the .NET table. Improvements in DFS, defrag, chkdsk and EFS just scratch the surface. New WHQL processes are being established for antivirus products, allowing them to hook directly into the OS. Virtual Disk Service, Volume Shadow Copy Service and promised improvements in the File Replication Service should make managing storage easier and more flexible. P4 Performance Goes to Court http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,104075,tk,dn081602X,00.asphttp://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,104075,tk,dn081602X,00.asp A class action lawsuit has been filed in California by a small group of PC owners that are miffed about the performance, or lack thereof, that was promised by Intel, HP and Gateway. Since the day the P4 was introduced, the overall performance has been criticized, so this would seem to be more an issue of failing to do proper due diligence on the part of the customer, if you ask me. This is one of those subjective questions that will come down to fancy lawyers and luck of the jury pool draw. If they believed everything the TV commercials had to say, then the litigants got what they had coming. One beer tastes better than the next, only one car can save your life in a crash, etc. This general lag in P4 muscle has been publicized since day one, as have crash test results on the part of the government and third-party organizations. Should we be suing auto makers when someone dies in a 5-star rated vehicle? That Volvo will save your life, ya know. Does this set an unreasonable expectation?

Click Here ------------------------------------------------------------ The Freedom Rides
By Denis Mueller At the end of World War II, the United States was a rigidly segregated country but there were cracks beginning to show. In 1946, the Supreme Court ruled that ruled that segregated seating on interstate transportation was illegal. In 1947, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) decided to challenge the racist system. The opposition was fierce and the riders were jailed often ending up on chain gangs. By 1961, the time was right to challenge America's Jim Crow laws and CORE proposed the ""Freedom Rides."" CORE felt that they could count on the racists to oppose the rides thereby creating a crisis that would force the Federal Government to intervene to enforce the law. It would be dangerous and CORE members knew that they were risking their lives, but as CORE director James Farmer maintained they were ready. ""When we began the ride I think all of us were prepared for as much violence as could be thrown at us. We were prepared for the possibility of death."" ------------------------------------------------------------ * S E X...S E X...S E X...S E X * NOW THAT WEVE GOT YOUR ATTENTION...

AOL Users Click Here ------------------------------------------------------------ On May 4th, 1961 they set out to New Orleans. In the upper south they met no resistance but by the time they got to Alabama they were met by an angry band of terrorists who slashed the tires and burned the bus. In Birmingham it was worse. The FBI, through its informant James Rowe, were well aware that the Ku Klux Klan was waiting for them. So were the Birmingham police, led by Chief of police Bull Conner, and when they arrived they were severely beaten. Despite the warnings there were no police to protect them. Governor Patterson showed no mercy and blamed the riders. So the terrorist attacks went on. The ""Freedom Riders"" were determined to continue and were joined by a group of Nash-
ville students. They were met by hostility and were arrested and sent back to Tennessee. But the riders were fearless and immediately returned to Birmingham ready to continue the journey. ------------------------------------------------------------ ---------> The Paranormal Insider Is Here! <--------- ShagMail is PROUD to introduce our one and only paranormal investigator, Gus.

State officials had promised Attorney General Robert Kennedy they would be protected, but by the time they reached Montgomery there were no state police in sight. Seeing a mob, the riders feared for their lives, but Jim Zwerg, a white man, bravely walked out of the bus and was nearly beaten to death. He still suffers from the effects but his courage was un-
deniable. Others including Justice Department official John Seigenthaler were also beaten. The situation seemed to be out of control and federal inter-
vention finally saved the day with Governor Patterson declar-
ing martial law. Robert Kennedy called for a cooling off period but the riders refused. They would continue on. So they set off to Jackson, Mississippi but Kennedy had made a deal with Mississippi officials. They were supposed to be protected, but upon arriving they were arrested. Kennedy had caved in. It was a cowardly decision by the Attorney General and the riders were sentenced for 60 days for exercising their constitutional rights. They never finished their trip but their courage showed the power of civil disobedience and in the end justice would prevail and terrorism would be defeated. It is another example of how people change things, not government officials.

A suburban family finds themselves the objects of obsession of an
employee at a film-processing center in their local mall. An island getaway
An island in Tracadie harbour is about to become the Nova Scotia getaway
for movie stars Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman and their two children. Owner Marie Kelly confirmed she is finalizing
the sale of her 3.6-hectare island, which comes complete with two
cottages and road access across a 60-metre land bridge. She didn't
divulge the price. The couple, whom she met through a mutual friend in
the area, had discussed buying the island four years ago. But she didn't
make the decision to sell until January when her family was no longer
interested in keeping their summer home, purchased in the late 1960s.
Hawke, an Oscar nominee for his role in Training Day in 2001, visited
the Tracadie area in June. He is now on tour to promote his second book,
Ash Wednesday. His first novel, Hottest State, was published in 1996.
Thurman is known for her 1994 lead roles in Even Cowgirls Get the Blues
and Pulp Fiction, for which she received an Oscar nomination. British boys reserved?
Gorgeous Gwyneth Paltrow ,
currently single and searching for love, has complained that British men
just don't play the dating game the way she's used to. The 29-year-old
actress, who has a home in London and was there to perform on stage in
Proof, says: ""British people don't seem to ask each other out on dates.
If someone asks you out they're really going out on a limb, whereas in
America, it happens all the time. It's no big deal and no weight should
be attached to it. It's only dinner, for God's sake."" Gwyneth,
previously attached to Hollywood heartthrobs Brad Pitt and Ben Affleck ,
admits she was asked out a couple of times when last in London, and she
accepted with pleasure. One of her ""very charming"" dates was actor James
Purefoy ,
who starred in A Knight's Tale, she told a magazine. But who flew in to
really save the day? A hardy Canadian lad, that's who. Word about town
is that singer Bryan Adams recently squired Ms. Paltrow around town. A one-on-one interview
Muscle-bound Vin Diesel ,
star of the current hit movie XXX, isn't shy around reporters. In fact,
he was so taken by Entertainment Tonight reporter, Maria Manounos, that
he asked her out! Menounos, 24, is a former Massachusetts Teen USA
winner. She got the chance to interview the 35-year-old Diesel in July
and when the subject of dating came up, she asked if he was ""available"".
It turns out he was and a week later the pair ran into each other again
at the premiere of XXX in Westwood, California. When he saw Maria,
according to a tabloid news report, he grabbed her hand and started
whispering in her ear. He was overhead promising to see her later in the

"""Michael Moore's Mailing List"" <mailinglist@michaelmoore.com>","On The Way to Telluride, On My Way Back to the World","On The Way to Telluride, On My Way Back to the World 8/29/02 Dear friends, I go to turn my computer on but I have forgotten where the on/off switch
is. I have had this laptop for three years, but I haven't turned it on for
the past two months. I look on its left side, I feel around the back, I
find it on the right and I feel like an idiot. The screen reads ""fatal
error"" and offers to ""save"" whatever I had typed on it last June 21st, a
few weeks before my mother died. I hit CTL.ALT.DEL. and it is gone. Gone.
Gone like this long, sad, summer, frozen now, and nothing seemingly matters
but everything matters more now than ever before. Why did she have to die?
When will this pain stop? I got up this morning to fly out to Colorado. The Telluride Film Festival
is screening my film tomorrow night, the first time it will be shown in the
United States. My mother did not get to see this new film. She was always
so proud of everything I did, cheering me on every day from the day where
my memory begins. I had shown an early cut of the film to my friends last
winter in my parent's living room, and mom would come in and out of the
room, catching a scene here and there, saying, ""Boy, that's something,
isn't it!"" I don't feel right, right now. I have avoided most people for the past two
months. I can't conceive in my mind having to face a crowd of strangers, no
matter how supportive or appreciative they may be. Everyone says to me it
will be good to get back to work, good to be busy, take my mind off my
sadness, as if not aware that what I really might need is for it to be the
other way around. At my family's insistence, I tried going on TV a few
weeks ago to talk about the corporate crooks roaming our great land. I had
decided to give it a try, and gave it my best shot, and ended up feeling so
empty and more alone. I had agreed to go on ""Crossfire"" and Donahue (thank
God for this guy!) on the condition that I would not have to have one of
those stupid cable news shouting matches with three rightwingnuts where no
one can hear (or wants to hear) what's being said. They agreed to the terms, but as Bob Novak asked his first question about
aren't my true motives to destroy capitalism and make America a socialist
country, I just sat there for a moment and didn't respond. I thought I
would just take the microphone off and leave - who needs these f-----s! -
but then, my dad was with me in the studio and I looked over at him and
smiled, and then into the camera I said, yes, Bob, that is exactly what I
intend to do and, considering more people have bought my book than any
other nonfiction book in America this year, I guess that means that the
majority of Americans agree with me on this point, so look out Bob 'cause
we're going to seize your money first! I asked the studio audience in DC
for a show of hands of all those who agreed and I was later told that
numerous hands shot up in the air, much to the chagrin of a stunned Bob
Novak. I also added that I thought the Pope was onto something when he said
that capitalism is a ""sin."" My dad liked that. He is a sweet, strong, smart man and I loved the drive
with him back home. We took a spin through the Michigan State campus and he
told me how he had come down here after World War II to inquire about going
to college but thought it best to return to the assembly line where he had
a secure job. His years during the war serving in the Marines were going to
be counted toward his seniority. And so he worked the spark plug and oil
filter assembly line for 33 years and provided for mom and us kids and gave
us all his love -- which, of course, mattered the most. * * * * * * Dad took me to the airport this morning, remarking on the way how much mom
would have enjoyed this simple trip across town to Bishop Airport, how
happy she would have been knowing that I was heading off on a new journey
in my very fortunate life. I thought about how she came to New York for the
screening of ""Roger & Me"" at the New York Film Festival in 1989, and how I
got to introduce her and my aunt as they sat in the front of the balcony,
and how mom and Aunt Lois stood and took a long Lincoln Center bow, and how
I stood on that stage and felt that she deserved every bit of that applause
and more. It's a bittersweet memory now, as I've just found out that the NYFF
selection committee this year is too afraid to show my new film.
""Politics,"" is what I have been told. Too ""populist"" for the new elite who
now sit in judgment of what is art. ""They don't want to help further your
platform Mike,"" a person close to the committee tells me. ""One of them even
said, 'I know this film is going to be popular - and I don't personally
want to contribute to its popularity.'"" So, it was decided that ""Bowling
for Columbine,"" a Cannes prize-winner, knighted by the Chicago Tribune as
""one of the most effective political/polemical films ever,"" a film chosen
by every single film festival around the world this fall - no, this film
must not be shown at Lincoln Center just six blocks from the edit room
where we made it... 77 blocks north of ground zero. I've gone too far this
time, cut too close to the bone, stuck my lens where it doesn't belong -
right straight through the heart of an America that is both master and
victim of the ultra-violence. It is so sad to see this place where I will
always remember my mother taking that bow now cowering to the whims of neos
who, like their counterparts in Hollywood, preside over the demolition of a
once great art form. * * * * * * * My dad drops me off and goes to park in the short-term lot. He comes inside
just as the airport personnel are taking everything out of my suitcase for
inspection. They don't ask to see the print of the film, the only thing I
might have had on me that is poised to do any real damage (to all the right
people, of course). My dad and I stop short of the metal detectors and the
next round of inspectors who are anxious to look at my smelly feet. We hug,
and he kisses me, and I am trying hard, so very hard, to not break down in
the middle of this airport. He tells me not to worry about him, and I tell
him I'll call him from Detroit when I am changing planes. I go through
security and as I am being taken aside to be searched again, I look back
and see him still standing there, watching out for me. My dad. I'm on the plane and I'm thirsty, but I took the water bottle out of my bag
when I packed it this morning. The bottle, half-drank, had been sitting
untouched in my untouched bag since I stuck it in there the night we had to
rush my mom to the hospital. The bottle was still there in that overnight
bag where I put my t-shirt and sweatpants, the ones I had on for the night
and day I sat by my mother's side in the hospital as she struggled to live,
holding her hand, holding her head, trying to comfort her, strands of hair
on my sweater. I can see the stains from where my tears and mucus ran
uncontrollably down my face and onto that sweater. The doctor said she had
an 80% chance of making it. An hour before she died, another doctor said
the chances were 1 in 100. That was good enough for me. One in one hundred!
I've had those odds! I won! Don't let her die! Please do everything you can
do! Don't let her die. The priest came, then another priest came, and when the priests left my dad
asked us three kids and the three grandkids to all join hands and say our
goodbyes to mom, say whatever we wanted to about what she meant to us. (I
am sorry... I cannot complete this paragraph right now, I can't see the
screen through the tears...maybe someday...) The night before we rushed her to the hospital I had a little surprise
planned for her. I had brought a copy of my new movie and I was going to
show it to her. As the end credits would roll, she would get to see what
she has seen at the end of all of my work: her name along with my dad's in
that list of credits...and, to me, it's the only real credit that ever
mattered -- because without them I would not have the life they gave me,
the way they raised me... it is all a privilege I will never cease being
thankful for. I never got to show her the movie that night. ""Mike!"" she called out from
the porch, in a pitch of voice I had never heard. ""Get your father! I don't
feel good."" She was, without warning, dying. Within 48 hours she would be
gone. * * * * * * I'm walking through the Detroit airport to gate 75 for the flight to
Denver, and I hear someone say, ""OK, Mr. Stuckup, just walk right on by!"" I
turn to see it is one of anchors from the local TV station in Flint. I
apologize. My sunglasses are on. I have been crying since I left my dad at
the Flint airport. I explain this to her and she starts to get tears in her
eyes. ""My mom died in October,"" she says, and I realize that this pain that
feels so solitary is, truthfully, a shared experience amongst us all. No
one is immune from this loss. But instead of taking the time to tell me
about how rough it has been for HER, she asks about how I am doing and how
is my dad doing and did we get the flowers she and the others sent. She
gives me her number and says to call anytime if I feel the need to talk. At
that moment I remember what she told me -- that her mother also died this
year-- and I think, man, get over yourself, Mike, you are not alone in
this, and so I ask her how she is doing. ""I think a lot,"" she says, ""about
all the things she won't see my two children grow up to do, to be. But I

all."" They call my flight and I rush over to the payphone to call my dad to see
if he got home OK. He tells me that when he left the short- term lot he got
talking to the person in the tollbooth who told him about her mother
getting cancer and how she was caring for her. ""She said that her bill in
the hospital came to $60,000,"" he says with astonishment. ""They won't be
able to pay it. She makes six dollars an hour, no health insurance. I gave
her a tip along with the toll."" ""You gave the tollbooth worker a tip?"" ""Well, you have to. That person could be you or me."" That is my father. That was my mother. Yours, Michael Moore

tom <twang@mountainviewdata.com>,a deadlock problem,"Hi XFS developers,
When studying xfs code(2.4.19), I found that the inode will be locked by XFS_ILOCK_SHARE flags before we get acl, which may cause deadlock.
Because when getting acl, it will allocate memory in KM_SLEEP, If the memory is tight, the process will call xfs_strategy, and may lock(XFS_ILOCK_SHARE)the same inode again. If between these two locks, another process try to lock the inode by XFS_ILOCK_EXCL, these two processes will be deadlock. As follows, A process get ea B process want lock ipA 1) xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_SHARE) ..................... | | | | get acl 2) xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_EXCL) | | | | memory tight | | xfs_stragegy | |
3)xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_SHARE) ............................ these two processes will be dead lock. So I believe that acl allocation GFP_MASKshould be changed to KM_NOFS.
right? best regards wdd "

http://www.mindview.net/Calendar ===================================
* Come work on Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, in Crested Butte All but one of the Interns has departed (he's staying through
December) and we have empty rooms in the condo that I rented in Mt.
Crested Butte for the Interns to stay in. If you'd like to
volunteer to come up (Crested Butte is gorgeous in late
Summer/early Fall, with excellent hiking and mountain biking), stay
in the condo, and help work on the 3rd edition of Thinking in Java,
please email Sharlynn@Mindview.net with your resume and
availability dates (note that the book is due at the end of
October). There will be a technical and writing test, and
interviews to reveal how well you self-motivate and work with
others. This should be a great learning experience and a fun time. ===================================
* Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, Revision 2 Imminent The second revision will be up on the site soon, at:
http://64.78.49.204/ The biggest change is that I've rewritten significant part of the
multithreading chapter (although it still has a ways to go). The
goal is to rewrite the chapter to introduce the essence of
threading with simplicity, and without GUI examples (this
simplifies things, and allows threads to appear before GUIs). The chapters have also been reorganized into something like their
final form, although the final chapter numbering hasn't been done
yet. We have made more progress in the testing system. Other details of the changes made in the new version will be at the
beginning of the book. The book is due at the end of October. The print version will
appear in December. ===================================
* Thinking in C++, Volume 2, Revision 9 Available tomorrow Available at:
http://64.78.49.204/ Chapters 1-4 are finished ===================================
* Thinking in Java Hands-on Seminar
November 4th-8th in San Francisco - Emeryville, CA.
Registration opens on September 4th.
http://www.mindview.net/Seminars/ThinkingInJava/ Created by Bruce Eckel, taught by Andrea Provaglio. We believe this
is the best in-depth introduction to Java that you'll find. It's
based on the book ""Thinking in Java,"" which was created as the
seminar evolved. Please note the early registration discount: * $1,600 for payments received by October 12th
* $1,950 for payments received after October 12th ===================================
* Java2 Enterprise Programming Seminar
November 18th-22th in San Francisco - Emeryville, CA.
Registration opens on September 4th.
http://www.mindview.net/Seminars/J2EE/ Created and taught by Andrea Provaglio, this seminar introduces you
to the practical development of real-world, Web-enabled,
distributed applications with Java. It covers J2EE and its key
technologies: Enterprise JavaBeans, Servlets, Java ServerPages, and
the basic architectural patterns used to combine these technologies
into maintainable applications. Andrea has been teaching this course in the US and in Europe for
the last two years, and he has recently restructured and updated
the seminar to include the latest J2EE features. You'll come out of this course with a comprehensive understanding
of the J2EE architecture, of the problems that it is designed to
solve, how to select the most appropriate tools, and how to code
your solutions. Please note the early registration discount: * $1,700 for payments received by October 26th
* $2,300 for payments received after October 26th ===================================
* New seminars Bill Venners and I just finished giving the last ""Objects &
Patterns"" seminar, and everyone (especially us) had a great time. We are now beginning to work towards the two new seminars spawned
by Objects & Patterns, which Bill and I plan to teach together:
Design Patterns in Java
(Drawing primarily from ""Thinking in Patterns"") Designing Objects & Systems
This will include a lot of material from Bill's upcoming book on
Object Design, along with coverage of UML, XP, Object-Oriented
Design techniques and guidelines, and of course exercises and
projects. We hope to begin teaching the courses early next year. Stay tuned. ===================================
* Limited Number of Signed Copies of TIJ2 for sale I'm selling the last 17 of my author copies of Thinking in Java,
2nd edition. I've signed each one and drawn a little cartoon with
the signature (the books are in La Mesa, and I'm in Crested Butte,
so unfortunately I can't personalize them). The cost in the USA is
$40, which includes handling and mailing. Outside the USA, you'll
have to email to the address below to find out the additional
shipping cost. To order, divide your credit card number (Visa, MC, Amex) into two
different emails (not high security, but highly likely to be safe),
and include your credit card billing address and expiration date.

########################################################################## ------------------------------ From: Frederick Noronha Subject: NEWS: GNU/DEVELOPMENT... intl orgns take a close look at GNU/Linux
Date: 8 Sep 2002 01:25:42 GMT GNU/DEVELOPMENT, INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT GNU/LINUX >From Frederick Noronha INDIA: There's good news round the corner -- international organisations and
prominent networks worldwide are waking up to the rich potential of
Free/Open Source Software, a field that is slowly being recognised for the
immense promise it holds out to the Third World. But can this be tapped speedily enough and effectively? >From the Unesco to the World Bank, and other global organisations, all are
catching up on the potential of using GNU/Linux as a potent tool in working
towards development. More so in countries where the cost of a proprietorial
office suite could eat up six months or more of the average citizen's
earnings. United Nation's Development Programme's Ms. Radhika Lal
, a Information-Communication Technology Policy
Advisor, recently drew attention to a conference on Open Source for
E-Government. It is to be held in Washington, DC on October 17-18. infoDev, the Cyberspace Policy Institute of The George Washington
University, and the UNDP are jointly behind this event. It is intended to
draw participants from local, national and international organizations from
both the public and private sector. This meet intends to present cases of 'best practices', raise awareness
about the potential of open source and free software for e-governance. More
importantly, it will be sharing experiences among policy makers, donors,
users and consumers, universities, and industry specialists in Open Source,
e-Government and related fields. Ms Lal works at the ICT-for-Development's Special Initiative Bureau for
Development Policy at the UNDP's East 45th Street offices in New York. ICT-for-development is a campaign to use more of infotech and the Internet
for global development and fighting problems like poverty and illiteracy.
But despite quite a few shared goals and concerns with the GNU/Linux world,
so far little networking has been done between these two separate circles. See http://www.egovos.org/ OTHER ARMS OF THE U.N.
====================== Besides, the UNDP, other arms of the United Nations are also known to be
showing increasing interest in the potential of free software/open source
tools. Paris-headquartered Unesco (United Nations Education, Scientific and
Cultural Organisation) recently launched its own Free Software portal. It's at http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft. UNESCO's Jean-Claude Dauphin of the Information
Society Division also announced that this international organisation has
been looking out for contributors with a good knowledge of the Free Software
movement in relation with UNESCO fields of competence -- education, science
and culture. It zeroed in particularly on those coming from the Third World (also called
the 'South' countries) who could could make propositions for ""revising,
updating and extending the UNESCO Free Software Portal"" as well as for
including new basic documents. ""This work could be done using a fee or consultant contract and the fee can
be discussed depending on the amount of work described in the contract,""
said Dauphin. Check out the sites at UNESCO Libraries Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_bib/)
UNESCO Archives Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_archives/)
UNESCO Free Software Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft/)
UNESCO Observatory on the Information Society (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/observatory/) NEW TOOLS FOR CDS/ISIS
====================== Recently, Unesco also announced the launch of new tools for data exchange
from and to its CDS/ISIS software. These two new tools -- ImpExp2709 and
IsisAscii v 0.92 -- have recently been released for data exchange from and
to UNESCO's software package CDS/ISIS. CDS/ISIS is a generalized information storage and retrieval system that is
freely distributed, and has attracted users in places like libraries within
the Third World. The new utilities have been released with their source code
(GPL license). See http://www.unesco.org/webworld/news/2002/020806_isis.shtml Meanwhile, UNDP's APDIP (Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme)
based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is also learnt to be thinking seriously
about organizing some kind of a consultation on open source, GNU/Linux and
related issues. ""We want to see how we can further this cause in the region,"" APDIP's Shahid
Akhtar told this correspondent. Niranjan Rajani , of Pakistani origin but based
in the birthplace of Linux, Finland, is now working on a research project on
""Significance of Free/OpenSource Software for Developing Countries"". This project is financed by the Finnish Foreign Ministry, and he has
undertaken to write the paper by the end of November this year, for
Maailma.Net, a local division of OneWorld.Net. This project's goal is to find out, evaluate and analyze the extent of use
of FS/OSS, especially some of its most significant and popular projects;
GNU/Linux, Apache, Mozilla, OpenOffice etc. in the developing or Third World
countries. It will also look at its possible impact on economies, societies
and lives of these countries. CONVINCING GOVERNMENTS
====================== In India, organisations like Red Hat have been putting out slick
presentations to convince governments and officials to try out Open Source. Shift over boldly to the world of 'open source' and 'free' software. That's
the message that governments across India were recently with, as official
computerisation efforts get bogged down due to spiraling software costs and
speedy software-fuelled hardware obsolence. Senior IT and e-governance officials from across the country tuned in
attentively during a recent seminar in Goa, as executives from computing
giant IBM and leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India narrated long
lists of benefits that governments could get from going the Linux way. Pointing to examples from across the globe, Red Hat India argued that the US
Department of Energy has built supercomputers on GNU/Linux, the Chinese are
making Linux the official server operating system -- to be widely used in
varsities, military installations and within government. Some months back, an organisation under India's Ministry of Information
Technology -- called the ER&DCI (Electronics Research and Development Centre
of India) -- entered into a strategic alliance with leading Linux systems
supplier Red Hat India to popularize the 'open source' solution in the
government sector. On networks like the EDC/World Bank-support GKD (Global Knowledge for
Development), issues of free software and open source often make it to the
news. GNU/Linux is a suitable tool in organising too, as it was recently pointed
out. (See http://www.lincproject.org) ""The Low Income Networking and Communication (LINC) Project of the Welfare
Law Center has helped many low-income led organizing groups acquire access
to the Internet and use technology more effectively,"" says Dirk Slater
. While these groups have increased their abilities to communicate with one
another and their allies by using the Internet, one communication hurdle
remains -- communicating with their leadership via the Internet. Despite many ""digital divide"" initiatives addressing access to the Internet
in low-income communities, access is still an issue. Public Internet access points, such as libraries and schools, are not
sufficient, as Slater has pointed out. Many low-income leaders do not have
access to the Internet where it would make the most impact -- in their
homes. LINC argues that the need for Internet communication is particularly great
for rural groups whose members live far apart and cannot have frequent
face-to-face meetings because of distance, time and money constraints. ""We began to explore the idea of using Linux, a free operating system that
works well on older computers, when we learned of Microsoft's decision to
discontinue support of its older operating systems like Windows 95 NEED TO NETWORK
=============== Bala Pillai , who was earlier based in Malaysia and now in
Sydney-Australia, is founder of Tamil Innaiyam (http://www.tamil.net), an
organisation to promote the Tamil language worldwide. He points to the
impact GNU/Linux is making in some distant areas of the Third World. Says Pillai: ""The most interactive open source/Linux community in our time
zone/Asia springs out of the Philippines. Primarily because the Filipino
psyche is a more secure psyche, a more self-confident psyche. ""Folks who are self-confident worry about the future less, and allocate more
time diagnosing and solving problems rather than echoing and re-echoing it.
Filipinos are also more into sharing and online sharing -- we should look to
more symbiosis with them,"" says he. Pillai also notes that the Manila-based Miguel Paraz, whom he interacted
with since 1996, is a key catalyst in the Filipino Linux community.
""http://www.q-linux.com is a good starting point to get a feel for the key
Open Source catalysts in the Philippines,"" says he. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based Dinesh who runs http://www.alphaque.com is
another lead Open Source catalyst from the region, explains Pillai. ""Do look
for symbiosis opportunities there too,"" he suggests. ""I see lots of room for us to symbiosis together. For example, there is
likely to be areas where we diagnosing, documenting, analyzing, coding or
publicizing where there is over-duplication. If we coordinated ourselves and
found out where our circles and priorities intersect , we could share this
work and get fruits out faster,"" he adds.

########################################################################## ------------------------------ From: Frederick Noronha Subject: Attn programmers: support offered [FLOSS-Sarai Initiative]
Date: 8 Sep 2002 01:25:45 GMT Dear friends, Can we manage to get some money into backing Free/Libre Open Source
Software initiatives, that would help young volunteers out there to
support their cash-strapped initiatives? Sarai.net, a Delhi-based initiative under the CSDS (Centre for the Study
of Developing Societies) has been solidly supportive of such an idea. Jeebesh Bagchi sent in this offer recently. It could
surely be of help particularly to college students and others wanting to
make a break in Free Software/Open Source, but hamstrung by resources. It might help if projects are initially kept small and definitely workable, I guess. This is my own gut-level feeling, but maybe bigger
initiatives which are clearly workable could also prove convincing. If
such experiments prove useful, maybe there would be a good case for
greater support to free software/open source developers in regions like
ours. --FN ========== Forwarded message ========== The Sarai Programme, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi
(www.sarai.net) invites applications for Support Grants to projects in the
area of Free Software, Open Source Software and Social Usage of Software Sarai invites programmers (practictioners as well as students) to

"""JDC Tech Tips"" <body_216095411795471888@hermes.sun.com>","Core Java Technologies Tech Tips, September 10, 2002 (ArrayList vs. LinkedList, Zero-Length Arrays)"," Core Java Technologies Technical Tips In this Issue WELCOME to the Core JavaTM Technologies Tech Tips, September 10, 2002. Here you'll get tips on using core Java technologies and APIs, such as those in Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SETM). #1 These tips were developed using Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v 1.4. This issue of the JDC Tech Tips is written by Glen McCluskey. USING ARRAYLIST AND LINKEDLIST ArrayList and LinkedList are two Collections classes used for storing lists of object references. For example, you could have an ArrayList of Strings, or a LinkedList of Integers. This tip compares the performance of ArrayList and LinkedList, and offers some suggestions about which of these classes is the right choice in a given situation. The first key point is that an ArrayList is backed by a primitive Object array. Because of that, an ArrayList is much faster than a LinkedList for random access, that is, when accessing arbitrary list elements using the get method. Note that the get method is implemented for LinkedLists, but it requires a sequential scan from the front or back of the list. This scan is very slow. For a LinkedList, there's no fast way to access the Nth element of the list. Consider the following example. Suppose you have a large list of sorted elements, either an ArrayList or a LinkedList. Suppose too that you do a binary search on the list. The standard binary search algorithm starts by checking the search key against the value in the middle of the list. If the middle value is too high, then the upper half of the list is eliminated. However, if the middle value is too low, then the lower half of the list is ignored. This process continues until the key is found in the list, or until the lower bound of the search becomes greater than the upper bound. Here's a program that does a binary search on all the elements in an ArrayList or a LinkedList: import java.util.*; public class ListDemo1 { static final int N = 10000; static List values; // make List of increasing Integer values static { Integer vals[] = new Integer[N]; Random rn = new Random(); for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i &lt; N; i++) { vals[i] = new Integer(currval); currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1; } values = Arrays.asList(vals); } // iterate across a list and look up every // value in the list using binary search static long timeList(List lst) { long start = System.currentTimeMillis(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) { // look up a value in the list // using binary search int indx = Collections.binarySearch( lst, values.get(i)); // sanity check for result // of binary search if (indx != i) { System.out.println( '*** error ***\n'); } } return System.currentTimeMillis() - start; } public static void main(String args[]) { // do lookups in an ArrayList System.out.println('time for ArrayList = ' + timeList(new ArrayList(values))); // do lookups in a LinkedList System.out.println( 'time for LinkedList = ' + timeList(new LinkedList(values))); } } The ListDemo1 program sets up a List of sorted Integer values. It then adds the values to an ArrayList or a LinkedList. Then Collections.binarySearch is used to search for each value in the list. When you run this program, you should see a result that looks something like this: time for ArrayList = 31 time for LinkedList = 4640 ArrayList is about 150 times faster than LinkedList. (Your results might differ depending on your machine characteristics, but you should see a distinct difference in the result for ArrayList as compared to that for LinkedList. The same is true for the other programs in this tip.) Clearly, LinkedList is a bad choice in this situation. The binary search algorithm inherently uses random access, and LinkedList does not support fast random access. The time to do a random access in a LinkedList is proportional to the size of the list. By comparison, random access in an ArrayList has a fixed time. You can use the RandomAccess marker interface to check whether a List supports fast random access: void f(List lst) { if (lst instanceof RandomAccess) { // supports fast random access } } ArrayList implements the RandomAccess interface, and LinkedList. does not. Note that Collections.binarySearch does take advantage of the RandomAccess property, to optimize searches. Do these results prove that ArrayList is always a better choice? Not necessarily. There are many cases where LinkedList does better. Also note that there are many situations where an algorithm can be implemented efficiently for LinkedList. An example is reversing a LinkedList using Collections.reverse. The internal algorithm does this, and gets reasonable performance, by using forward and backward iterators. Let's look at another example. Suppose you have a list of elements, and you do a lot of element inserting and deleting to the list. In this case, LinkedList is the better choice. To demonstrate that, consider the following 'worst case' scenario. In this demo, a program repeatedly inserts elements at the beginning of a list. The code looks like this: import java.util.*; public class ListDemo2 { static final int N = 50000; // time how long it takes to add // N objects to a list static long timeList(List lst) { long start = System.currentTimeMillis(); Object obj = new Object(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) { lst.add(0, obj); } return System.currentTimeMillis() - start; } public static void main(String args[]) { // do timing for ArrayList System.out.println( 'time for ArrayList = ' + timeList(new ArrayList())); // do timing for LinkedList System.out.println( 'time for LinkedList = ' + timeList(new LinkedList())); } } When you run this program, the result should look something like this: time for ArrayList = 4859 time for LinkedList = 125 These results are pretty much the reverse of the previous example. When an element is added to the beginning of an ArrayList, all of the existing elements must be pushed back, which means a lot of expensive data movement and copying. By contrast, adding an element to the beginning of a LinkedList simply means allocating an internal record for the element and then adjusting a couple of links. Adding to the beginning of a LinkedList has fixed cost, but adding to the beginning of an ArrayList has a cost that's proportional to the list size. So far, this tip has looked at speed issues, but what about space? Let's look at some internal details of how ArrayList and LinkedList are implemented in Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition v 1.4. These details are not part of the external specification of these classes, but are illustrative of how such classes work internally. The LinkedList class has a private internal class defined like this: private static class Entry { Object element; Entry next; Entry previous; } Each Entry object references a list element, along with the next and previous elements in the LinkedList -- in other words, a doubly-linked list. A LinkedList of 1000 elements will have 1000 Entry objects linked together, referencing the actual list elements. There is significant space overhead in a LinkedList structure, given all these Entry objects. An ArrayList has a backing Object array to store the elements. This array starts with a capacity of 10. When the array needs to grow, the new capacity is computed as: newCapacity = (oldCapacity * 3) / 2 + 1; Notice that the array capacity grows each time by about 50%. This means that if you have an ArrayList with a large number of elements, there will be a significant amount of space wasted at the end. This waste is intrinsic to the way ArrayList works. If there was no spare capacity, the array would have to be reallocated for each new element, and performance would suffer dramatically. Changing the growth strategy to be more aggressive (such as doubling the size at each reallocation) would result in slightly better performance, but it would waste more space. If you know how many elements will be in an ArrayList, you can specify the capacity to the constructor. You can also call the trimToSize method after the fact to reallocate the internal array. This gets rid of the wasted space. So far, this discussion has assumed that either an ArrayList or a LinkedList is 'right' for a given application. But sometimes, other choices make more sense. For example, consider the very common situation where you have a list of key/value pairs, and you would like to retrieve a value for a given key. You could store the pairs in an N x 2 Object array. To find the right pair, you could do a sequential search on the key values. This approach works, and is a useful choice for very small lists (say 10 elements or less), but it doesn't scale to big lists. Another approach is to sort the key/value pairs by ascending key value, store the result in a pair of ArrayLists, and then do a binary search on the keys list. This approach also works, and is very fast. Yet another approach is to not use a list structure at all, but instead use a map structure (hash table), in the form of a HashMap. Which is faster, a binary search on an ArrayList, or a HashMap? Here's a final example that compares these two: import java.util.*; public class ListDemo3 { static final int N = 500000; // Lists of keys and values static List keys; static List values; // fill the keys list with ascending order key // values and fill the values list with // corresponding values (-key) static { Integer keyvec[] = new Integer[N]; Integer valuevec[] = new Integer[N]; Random rn = new Random(); for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i &lt; N; i++) { keyvec[i] = new Integer(currval); valuevec[i] = new Integer(-currval); currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1; } keys = Arrays.asList(keyvec); values = Arrays.asList(valuevec); } // fill a Map with key/value pairs static Map map = new HashMap(); static { for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) { map.put(keys.get(i), values.get(i)); } } // do binary search lookup of all keys static long timeList() { long start = System.currentTimeMillis(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) { int indx = Collections.binarySearch( keys, keys.get(i)); // sanity check of returned value // from binary search if (indx != i) { System.out.println( '*** error ***\n'); } } return System.currentTimeMillis() - start; } // do Map lookup of all keys static long timeMap() { long start = System.currentTimeMillis(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) { Integer value = (Integer)map.get( keys.get(i)); // sanity check of value returned // from map lookup if (value != values.get(i)) { System.out.println( '*** error ***\n'); } } return System.currentTimeMillis() - start; } public static void main(String args[]) { // do timing for List implementation System.out.println(""List time = "" + timeList()); // do timing for Map implementation System.out.println('Map time = ' + timeMap()); } } The program sets up Lists of keys and values, and then uses two different techniques to map keys to values. One approach uses a binary search on a list, the other a hash table. When you run the ListDemo3 program, you should get a result that looks something like this: ArrayList time = 1000 HashMap time = 281 In this example, N has a value of 500000. Approximately, log2(N) - 1 comparisons are required in an average successful binary search, so each binary search lookup in the ArrayList will take about 18 comparisons. By contrast, a properly implemented hash table typically requires only 1-3 comparisons. So you should expect the hash table to be faster in this case. However, binary search is still useful. For example, you might want to do a lookup in a sorted list and then find keys that are close in value to the key used for the lookup. Doing this is easy with binary search, but impossible in a hash table. Keys in a hash table are stored in apparent random order. Also, if you are concerned with worst-case performance, the binary search algorithm offers a much stronger performance guarantee than a hash table scheme. You might also consider using TreeMap for doing lookups in sorted collections of key/value pairs. Let's summarize the key points presented in this tip: Appending elements to the end of a list has a fixed averaged cost for both ArrayList and LinkedList. For ArrayList, appending typically involves setting an internal array location to the element reference, but occasionally results in the array being reallocated. For LinkedList, the cost is uniform and involves allocating an internal Entry object. Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an ArrayList implies that the rest of the list must be moved. Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of a LinkedList has fixed cost. A LinkedList does not support efficient random access An ArrayList has space overhead in the form of reserve capacity at the end of the list. A LinkedList has significant space overhead per element. Sometimes a Map structure is a better choice than a List. For more information about Using ArrayList and LinkedLists, see section 16.6, List, and section 16.7, Map and SortedMap, in 'http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/collections/?s=04&w=37"" target=""_blankCollections trail in the Java Tutorial, Third Edition. USING ZERO-LENGTH ARRAYS Suppose that you are writing a Java application that involves some sort of data filtering. You have some raw data that you want to clean up and process in various ways. One of the methods you've written takes an array of integers, along with minimum and maximum values. The method goes through the array and eliminates 'outliers,' that is, values that are too small or too big. The result of the filtering process is a new array of cleaned-up data. How could you implement this kind of filtering method? Here's one approach: import java.util.*; public class ZeroDemo1 { // filter input array and throw away values // that are less than minval or greater than // maxval static int[] filterData( int indata[], int minval, int maxval) { // check parameters for errors if (indata == null) { throw new NullPointerException( 'indata is null'); } if (maxval &lt; minval) { throw new IllegalArgumentException( 'maxval &lt; minval'); } // count number of valid values // in input array int validcnt = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; indata.length; i++) { if (indata[i] &gt;= minval && indata[i] &lt;= maxval) { validcnt++; } } // if no valid values, return null if (validcnt == 0) { return null; } // copy valid values to new array // and return it int outdata[] = new int[validcnt]; for (int i = 0, j = 0; i &lt; indata.length; i++) { if (indata[i] &gt;= minval && indata[i] &lt;= maxval) { outdata[j++] = indata[i]; } } return outdata; } public static void main(String args[]) { // set up test array of integers int indata[] = new int[]{1, 3, -17, 8, 59}; // filter out values not in the range 1-10 int outdata1[] = filterData(indata, 1, 10); for (int i = 0; i &lt; outdata1.length; i++) { System.out.println(outdata1[i]); } // filter out values not // in the range 100-200 int outdata2[] = filterData( indata, 100, 200); for (int i = 0; i &lt; outdata2.length; i++) { System.out.println(outdata2[i]); } } } The filterData method does two scans of the input array. The first scan counts the number of valid data values. Then the method allocates a new array of the appropriate size, and copies the good values to it. If there are no good values, the method returns a null value for the array reference. The result of running the ZeroDemo1 program is: 1 3 8 Exception in thread 'main' java.lang.NullPointerException at ZeroDemo1.main(ZeroDemo1.java:72) The problem with this program is a rather basic one. The second call of filterData returns a null value, and the program fails to take this possibility into account. A better approach in this example would be to comment out the block of code that tests for the possibility of no valid data values: /* if (validcnt == 0) { return null; } */ When there is no valid data, the code will fall through to the next line, where a zero-length array is allocated: int outdata[] = new int[0]; This is perfectly legal Java usage. The representation of Java arrays includes the length of the array, and it's therefore possible to tell if an array has zero length. For the ZeroDemo1 example, if you anticipate that validcnt will often be zero, that is, data filtering will often eliminate all values from the input, then you could optimize away the second input scan by adding code like this: int outdata[] = new int[validcnt]; if (validcnt == 0) { return outdata; } Note that usage such as: int outdata[] = new int[]{}; is also legal, to initialize an array with a zero-length set of integer constants. In general, it's best not to return null from a method that returns an array type. Always returning an array, even if the array has zero length, greatly improves the generality of algorithms. If you anticipate that your methods will often return zero-length arrays, you might be concerned about the performance implications of allocating many such arrays. In this case, you can allocate a single array, and always return the same one, as follows: private static final int ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAY[] = new int[0]; This array is immutable (it can't be changed), and can be shared throughout your application. There's another way that zero-length arrays are used, as illustrated in the following example: import java.util.*; public class ZeroDemo2 { public static void main(String args[]) { // set up ArrayList and add strings to it List stringlist = new ArrayList(); stringlist.add('string 1'); stringlist.add('string 2'); stringlist.add('string 3'); // convert to String array String out[] = ( String[])stringlist.toArray( new String[0]); for (int i = 0; i &lt; out.length; i++) { System.out.println(out[i]); } } } The result of running the ZeroDemo2 program is: string 1 string 2 string 3 The ZeroDemo2 program sets up an ArrayList, and adds three strings to it. Then the program calls toArray to get a String array of the three elements in the ArrayList. In this example, the argument to toArray is 'new String[0]'. This argument serves a couple of purposes. First, if you have a String array that's big enough to hold the elements of the ArrayList, you can specify it as the argument to toArray. The method will use the String array. But if your array is not big enough, then the toArray method allocates an array to return the elements. It uses the type of the array that was passed in to determine the type of the allocated array. ArrayList stores its element references in an Object array. The toArray method needs to be told if there is some other type (such as String) to be used for returning the array of elements. The method uses reflection (java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance) to create an array of the appropriate type.

Judge to Consider Legality of Gnutella Software Los Angeles - Attorneys for StreamCast Networks, developers of the
popular Morpheus peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing software, filed
briefs in federal court on Monday seeking a ruling that distribution
of the software does not violate copyright law. Morpheus is a popular file-sharing application based on the
decentralized Gnutella P2P networking protocol. In their briefs seeking summary judgment, attorneys from the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the law firm of Brobeck,
Phleger and Harrison argued that distribution of the software is legal
because the product is capable of substantial noninfringing uses and
because StreamCast cannot control the various uses of the software. Supporting StreamCast in the motion is nine time Grammy nominee Janis
Ian, who believes that peer-to-peer software represents important new
opportunities for artists. On October 2, 2001, 28 of the world's largest entertainment companies
sued StreamCast for the allegedly infringing actions of users of its
product (MGM et al v. Grokster et al, Case No. 01-CV-8541 SVW). Additional briefs will be filed in the months to come, with oral
arguments set for December 2, 2002, before U.S. Federal District Court
Judge Stephen Wilson in Los Angeles.

John Perry Barlow, Mountain Girl Garcia Host Free Music Fest San Francisco - Join the Electronic Frontier Foundation and five Bay
Area bands for an afternoon of live music and outdoor fun at EFF's
second annual Share-In. The festival will be held in Golden Gate
Park's Music Concourse Bandshell on Saturday, September 14th from noon
- 5pm. The celebration of independent music will be hosted by Grateful
Dead lyricist and EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow and former wife of
the late great Jerry Garcia, Mountain Girl Garcia. Artists participating in this event will permit recording of their
performances by those in attendance in support of EFFs Open Audio
License (OAL). Musicians performing at the event include: the Box Set
Duo - clown princes of folk-rock, the classic funk band Funkmonsters,
celtic world-fusion group Hy Brassyl, harmony based folk-pop band
Atticus Scout, and Berkeley-based party band Shady Lady. In addition to music, the Share-In will feature performers including
Ashley Foster the One Wheeled Wonder, the Existential Circus,
Frantastic Hands, the Metronome Dancers, and Willy Bologna and his
Sideshow Circus. Bring your family and friends! Ben and Jerry's will sell their famous ice cream, and Cartwheel
Catering will be on site with hot dogs, pretzels, and churros. Proceeds from the Share-In will go directly to EFF's Campaign for
Audiovisual Free Expression (CAFE), which oversees projects such as
the Open Audio License. CAFE empowers the creative community in
cyberspace by protecting the public's access to and use of audiovisual
technologies. The Open Audio License is a tool that EFF has developed in order to
help artists share music more directly with their fans, without
sacrificing recognition for their creativity. The OAL encourages
collaboration, providing artists with an alternative to a business
model strictly driven by profit. Based on the open source and free
software initiatives for software development, the OAL encourages
artists to share with one another and their fans Adoption of the OAL does not mean that artists go unrewarded for their
work. On the contrary, the OAL permits artists to share single tracks
or performances and gain widespread recognition for their work without
relying on intermediaries. EFF encourages new models of music
distribution in the digital world that benefit the artists themselves.
The Internet makes it possible to drastically reduce the overhead for
packaging and distributing music, which is where record companies
currently spend most of the money that could be going to artists. EFF
is committed to developing tools that empower artists to take control
over their own art and to be compensated appropriately for their works. When: Saturday, September 14th, Noon-5pm Where: Music Concourse Bandshell in Golden Gate Park, near the

.................................................................... September 13, 2002
.................................................................... I. From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding. Pity the world, or else this glutton be, To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee. --------------------------------------------------------------------
Shakespeare, William. Sonnets. William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was a famous English poet,
dramatist, and actor, often regarded as the greatest English
writer of all time. Shakespeare's early life was spent in
Stratford-upon-Avon, where little else is known about him
until he married at age 18 to Anne Hathaway. He enjoyed
quick recognition as a skilled playwright in London as a
member of the Lord Chamberlain's Company (also known as the
King's Men). He retired in 1610, having spent a successful
career as a writer and heralded by royalty and peasants
alike. Shakespeare's privacy resulted in a sketchy timeline of the
writer's life, leading many over the years to attempt to
fill in the gaps, often with scraps of fact and fiction that
only result in nothing close to the truth (A truth we will
probably never know). Among the rumors and hypotheses
offered over the years: that he was gay; a womanizer;
illiterate (reciting his works to a scribe), and a puppet
(in which he didn't write the works but was encouraged to
take credit to shield the real writer -- a person with
political ties). Shakespeare's sonnets give readers a glimpse into the mind
and heart of the playwright. Published in 1609, the 154
sonnets involve the author's relationship with various
characters, including a striking young man, a mysterious
woman, and a rival poet. The identities of the characters
have also been the subject of much speculation over the
years, despite the fact that they may have been completely
created in the mind of the bard. --------------------------------------------------------------------

"""Laurie Warren"" <laurie@primal.ucdavis.edu>",Securing multiple virtual hosts,"I am trying to secure three of four virtual hostnames on our Apache server.
We are not taking credit card orders or user's personal information, but are
merely hoping to secure email and calendar web transactions for our users.
We are not running any secure applications on the root host. I have been testing this week with CA, client, and host certificate
requests, certificates, and keys, and think I have a fairly good beginner's
grasp of the commands and command line options. My questions are: 1. Is it necessary to create a CA certificate for each of the secure
virtual hosts, or can one CA certificate for the root be used to sign each
of the keys for all three common names we are trying to secure? 2. Even though the root host is not conducting secure transactions, am I
correct in configuring the server with a CACertificateFile in the main body
of httpsd.conf and then setting the CACertificateFile for each virtual host
in the section of httpsd.conf? This sort of assumes the
answer to 1. is - you need a CA for each virtual host. 3. Is it necessary to create a client certificate to distribute to our
users, or is it sufficient to have the CA certificate and a server
certificate for the virtual hosts? Wouldn't a client certificate only be
necessary if we were trying to verify the client's identity? Would that be
a good idea given our scenario? Thanks in advance for your help. ______________________________________________________________________

<isu@eircom.net>,[ILUG-Social] Re: Important - reenactor insurance needed,"My gut reaction would be to tell them to go and shite, but this might not help to solve the problem. People who do horsey gigs get insurance because they can prove that they are 'expert'. They can then get a quote. What about finding out what they are prepared to insure, and then tell them that you are pulling in your horns and will do what you are insured to do, and make sure no one chops up any one else.

of the list management page. 4. After entering the password for your subscription and clicking on
the 'Unsubscribe' button, you will be unsubscribed from the list
immediately. 5. To unsubscribe from more than one list, you must access the
management page for each, using the appropriate URL, listed at the bottom of
this email. To contact SUPPORT staff: 1. All mailing lists hosted by SourceForge.net are opt-in via a
three-way handshake. This is not a spam list; subscription to this list required you to respond to a confirmation email that was sent to
your email address. 2. SourceForge.net provides hosting for more than 20,000 different mailing lists; if you contact our support staff, you must provide A) the email address associated with this monthly mailing AND B) the list of mailing lists from the bottom of this mailing Without this information, it will be difficult to assist you. 3. Support is not provided by email. All support inquiries related
to this mailing should be submitted as a Support Request at this URL: https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=1&atid=200001 Proper issue reporting will help us to respond quickly. To change your subscription settings: 1. Make use of the list management URL and password for the list in question; from the list management page, you may change your password or subscription preferences. 2. If you do not already know your list management password, click on
the 'Email My Password To Me' button. List passwords will differ from list-to-list, and are different from the password you use on the SourceForge.net site, if you have an account there. If your email address is changing: 1. Access the URL provided for list management at the bottom of this
email. 2. Click on the name of the list, located at the bottom of the list management page (the link preceding the email address for the list
admin). 3. Follow the instructions in the 'Subscribing to...' section to
subscribe your NEW email address to the list. 4. Once subscribed, follow the instructions in the UNSUBSCRIBE
section (above) to unsubscribe the old address from the list in question. NOTE: There is no means to change the email address on your
subscriptions directly; use this procedure to change the subscriptions for each of
the lists you subscribe to. If you are a list ADMINISTRATOR and have lost your list admin
password: 1. Follow the instructions in the SUPPORT section of this message
(above) to request a reset of your list admin password. Please include a
list of the mailing lists whose passwords you need reset. No automated facility is provided to reset list admin passwords. Please note: As of 2002-08-20, this mailing will no longer include the
list management passwords for your subscriptions. If you have lost
your list management password, you will need to recover those
passwords on a per-list basis as described in #2 of the UNSUBSCRIBE
section, above. If you encounter a problem in accessing the mailing list management
page for a list, please contact the SourceForge.net team (see our
SUPPORT instructions, above) for assistance AFTER you try using a
different web browser for accessing that page. Thank you, the SourceForge.net team (mailing list management URLs follow)

Brian Fahrlander <kilroy@kamakiriad.com>,Apt repository authentication: it's time," Cliped from the latest CERT.org warning list: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""I. Description The CERT/CC has received confirmation that some copies of the source code for the Sendmail package have been modified by an intruder to contain a Trojan horse. The following files were modified to include the malicious code: sendmail.8.12.6.tar.Z sendmail.8.12.6.tar.gz These files began to appear in downloads from the FTP server ftp.sendmail.org on or around September 28, 2002. The Sendmail development team disabled the compromised FTP server on October 6, 2002 at approximately 22:15 PDT. It does not appear that copies downloaded via HTTP contained the Trojan horse; however, the CERT/CC encourages users who may have downloaded the source code via HTTP during this time period to take the steps outlined in the Solution section as a precautionary measure."" OK, it's now time to work out the PGP securing of apt repository traffic. I've never gotten anything but ""sitename.whatever will not be authenticated"" until running Redhat 8.0 when I get something about having ""No Key"" for various files. What's it take to ensure we're covered against this kind of childish/moronic/Microsoft-era problems? ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ben Liblit <liblit@eecs.berkeley.edu>,Re: RedHat 8.0 and his own freetype,"Following further study, I've concluded: 1. It is easy to enable the bytecode interpreter. 2. This noticeably improves rendering of non-antialiased text. 3. This noticeably *harms* rendering of antialiased text. Point #3 probably surprises the rest of you as much as it surprised me. Ever since turning on the bytecode interpreter, I've been bugged by a sense that the antialiased text in my GNOME2 applications just looked, well, wrong somehow. I finally took some comparison screen shots with and without the interpreter, and that made the difference crystal clear. Consider the two images attached below. The first, ""no-bytecodes.png"", shows some text rendered by a GNOME2 panel menu without the bytecode interpreter. Contrast this with the second, ""bytecodes.png"", taken with the bytecode interpreter enabled. When the bytecode interpreter is turned on, notice that several rendering anomalies appear: - Several letters are narrower, giving the whole run of text a more compressed feel. This is especially noticeable in ""R"" and ""o"". - The left side of the ""Q"" is painted in too light a shade of grey, causing it to drop out somewhat. ""C"", not in this sample, has the same problem. - ""Qu"" are set right up against each other, with insufficient whitespace between them. - ""M"" is distinctly asymmetric. - The enclosed loop of ""a"" looks muddy, as it is partially filled with grey. Contrast with ""a"" drawn without the bytecode interpreter, which has a nice clear open loop. Ick. Perhaps this is why Red Hat turned the bytecode interpreter off. It may improve non-antialiased rendering, but only at the expense of making a mess of antialiased rendering. This may come down to a matter of personal aesthetics, but for my part, I'm going back to Red Hat's standard packages with the bytecode interpreter turned *off*.

Jeff Bezos <jeffb@amazon.com>,Try our new Apparel store and get a 30 dollar thank you,"For almost a year, we've been working on a new effort that we're
finally ready to show you. We're proud to introduce our new Apparel
and Accessories store with over 400 major clothing brands (including
Gap, Old Navy, Nordstrom, Lands' End, Target, Eddie Bauer, Foot
Locker, and many more). Our goal is to provide complete apparel selection and offer it the
Amazon way-with easy navigation, a single shopping cart, your
shipping and payment information already on file, etc. Of course, none
of this would be possible without our many apparel store partners
(we're thankful to have such an amazing group of companies working
with us). We released a beta version of the Apparel store about a week ago, and
much to our surprise, tens of thousands of clothing and accessory
items have already been ordered. Through the first few days of our
beta, customers have ordered: * 14,487 shirts (Polo Ralph Lauren button-downs to DKNY blouses) * 1,843 jackets (Old Navy fleece to Polartec windbreakers) * 2,712 sweaters (Eddie Bauer V-necks to Liz Claiborne cardigans) * 140 swimsuits (Tommy Bahama to Speedo) * 9,408 pants (Gap khakis to Guess jeans) * 485 skirts (Nordstrom suede to Spiegel leather) * 1,461 sleepwear items (Marshall Field's satin robes to Lands' End flannel pajamas) * 3,254 pairs of shoes (Nike Air Max to Nine West boots) * 1,870 pairs of socks (Cole Haan cashmere-blend to OshKosh B'Gosh cotton) * 2,805 accessories (handbags, watches, scarves, etc.) * 3,287 pairs of underwear (Jockey briefs to Hugo Boss boxers). We all need clean underwear, right? We hope you'll check it out. You'll get a $30 promotional certificate
when you spend $50 or more in the new Apparel store (see details
below). We'd especially appreciate any feedback you have (please
reply to this email to share your thoughts). http://www.amazon.com/apparel Sincerely, Jeff Bezos

EFF is a member-supported nonprofit. Please sign up as a member today! ----------------------------------------------------------------- * ALERT UPDATE: Urge Your Representative to Co-Sponsor the DMCRA! As the legislative season ends, it is vitally important to gather
support for legislation that will be center-stage in the next session.
This is an opportunity to ask your representative to take a stand for
your rights. Ask her/him to co-sponsor the DMCRA today! Representatives Rick Boucher and John Doolittle recently introduced
the Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act (DMCRA, H.R. 5544), which
would require labelling on usage-impaired ""copy-protected"" compact
discs and would make several several amendments to 1998's infamous
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Take action here:

http://www.eff.org/support/ -=end=----------------------------------------------------------- * ALERT: Bait and Switch; Anticounterfeiting Bill Hurts Your Rights! Don't be fooled by Senator Biden's ""Anticounterfeiting Amendments of
2002"" (S. 2395, also known as ""the Biden Bill""). It started as an
attempt to stop organized crime from forging holograms and
counterfeiting money, but its scope has been greatly expanded to
include digital watermarks on copyrighted material. This is a sneaky
power-grab that would greatly diminish the rights of the public in
copyrighted works while expanding the power of copyright owners. It
goes well beyond the scope of current copyright law and could: ~ Prevent universities, libraries, and consumers from enjoying the
exceptions to the Copyright Act adopted by Congress. S. 2935 could
prohibit the use of interface information essential for software
interoperability and competition ~ Impose new responsibilities on Internet service providers and could
also require consumer electronics and computer manufacturers to
reconfigure their products. ~ Impose more severe criminal and civil penalties than permitted by
the Copyright Act for identical behavior This ""anticounterfeiting"" bill is a decoy; stand up for your rights
today! Subscribe to the EFF Action Center and send your member of
Congress an email, letter or fax. You can take action by going to: http://action.eff.org/action/index.asp?step=2&item=2274 Join EFF! For membership information see:
http://www.eff.org/support/ -=end=----------------------------------------------------------- * Canadian Trademark Law Overreaching EFF has been involved in several cases involving overreaching
trademark claims on the Internet. Recently we have learned about a
Canadian lawsuit over the website www.lawsnet.com, a nonprofit legal
information website focusing on the laws of Canada and China that seem
especially egregious. Lawsnet.com is a free legal information website that has been
published since 1998. Last year, Lawsnet.com's owner Ling Xia was sued
by Quicklaw, a subsidiary of global publishing giant LexisNexus Group.
Quicklaw claims that Lawsnet.com violates its rights in the name
LAW/NET. However, LAW/NET does not have a public Internet website
under that domain name. The name appears on a subsidiary webpage of
the Quicklaw.com website that offers public ""teasers"" in the form of
summaries of recent Canadian cases, with the full text only available
through the private, proprietary paid Quicklaw service for Canadian
lawyers. It seems clear that the two names are substantially
different, are used in different places (one as a teaser for a closed
computer service and the other for information freely available on the
public internet) and are not causing any consumer confusion. Even more
problematic, Quicklaw does not even have a Canadian trademark in the
term LAW/NET -- it applied for one in 1997 but has repeatedly filed
requests for extensions of time with the Canadian trademark
authorities. In contrast, Ms. Xia is in the final stages of having a
Canadian trademark issued for ""lawsnet."" Regardless of its weak case, Quicklaw has managed to drag Ms. Xia
through over a year of litigation and recently succeeded in securing a
court order requiring her to undergo an extensive ""discovery"" process
that threatens to drive her under. Although she has had some free
legal assistance in the past, this next phase will require
significantly more legal resources than her volunteer attorneys can
muster. Quicklaw is represented by a large Toronto firm, Borden Ladner
and Gervais, LLP. Abuse of trademark law (even here, when no official trademark has even
been granted) is a growing problem on the Internet, and it is
unfortunately becoming an international problem. EFF urges Quicklaw,
and its US-based parent company, to stop beating up on this free and
useful website. While trademark law is important when misuse of a mark
is causing consumer confusion, it does not -- and should not -- grant
ownership in words, especially descriptive words like ""laws"" and ""net""
when describing an online legal information service. Trademark law
should also not be a license for large corporations who sell legal
information (or any other nonproprietary information) to stop
individuals who want to use the power of the Internet to provide free
legal information to the public. For those who wish to help Ms. Xia directly, local Toronto lawyer and
part-time law professor Gil Lan has agreed to act as trustee for a
legal defence fund to be established for Ms. Xia. If you wish to help,
please contact: Mr. Gil Lan

print it out in that font. IMHO also contains hyperlinks to sites
of interest or relevance: read it while online, too, and check 'em

good this week. And after reading the phrase for what seemed like
the umpteen-thousandth time, we were idly wondering how many Irish
tech companies blamed their misfortunes ""on the global downturn"":
http://makeashorterlink.com/?S35A63392 Oh, so it's about 450 then. Thanks, Google. * The death occurred recently of that great Irish washtub musician
Lonnie Donegan. RIP. This seems like an apt time therefore to
reflect on his many accomplishments: his virtuoso playing of
utensil-based instruments, his worldwide commercial success, his
place in history as King of Skiffle, and how he wiped billions of
yen off the value of the Tokyo stock market:
http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=373A9C4F.61B@time.life
(""panic and subsequent 10+% decline of Tokyo Stock Exchange when Reuters
advised 'Lonnie Donnegan' was dead"")
and also at
http://xsls.com?80
(""to Japanese ears it sounded like Ronald Reagan""). * UCD's Literary and Historical Society this week awarded an honorary
fellowship to the tediously brilliant American multidisciplarian Dr
Noam Chomsky. Now the idea of some trifling college society
awarding a mere honorary fellowship actually sounds rather like an
insult to us, considering that Niall Quinn and Marian Finucane were
given *degrees* by DIT the very next day, but then Chomsky
apparently inspired some of Radiohead's most caterwaulingly blunted
songs, so we suppose it serves him right. Anyway, if you're an
admirer of the great man's hermeutic genius, linguistic philosophy
or contentious views on US foreign policy, perhaps you might also
appreciate his amazing interview of Tom Hanks:
http://www.sadiethepilot.com/aaweb/tapes.htm#tomnnoam Very special thanks to IMHO's London correspondent Ray Butler for
this one. * Key IMHO contributor Sean Lynch quite realistically predicts a post-
Budget dole queue for all of us, and wonders if we'll miss those
cash-and-job cow multinationals when they're gone? Not if their
Irish presence was as permanent and impressive as ""the world's
leading risk and insurance services firm"", he concludes:
http://www.marsh.ie
(compare and contrast with, say, http://www.marsh.co.uk/) * Also: we've been remiss in the past in not featuring
EircomTribunal.com's stalwart and righteous campaigning against
Eircom's crippling rates and crippled infrastructure in this
country. Well, we aim to redress that right now, by pointing out
(1) Their 'Banana Republic' international price comparison page at
http://www.eircomtribunal.com/dossier_banana_rep.html, which will
surely make you mad enough to
(2) Download and print out their marvellously bitter ""No More
Favours For You, Mr Eircom Employee"" flyer from
http://www.eircomtribunal.com/counterstrike_a2_nomore.html, designed
to be stuck under the windshields of the ubiquitous and bilious
blue/orange Eircom vans.
Now if only EircomTribunal.com could somehow could retrieve that
money we all lost on bloody Eircom shares... * * * * * * * * * IMHO'S PICK: JOB....................IMHO HO HO (AND A BOTTLE OF RUM) ""FATHER CHRISTMAS on a bike - Student - Giving out FREEBIES - Four
weeks"". No, not us telegraphing our worst nightmare to our shrink,
but a job description for a position that apparently pays ""enough"".
Email tmckeagney@msn.com or hell, cycle into his perfume shop at 128
The Stephens Green Centre and show him what you can do. And hey, if you're a crazy maniac, that's great too. It's about
time we had an Irish SANTACON - after all, no force on earth can
stop one hundred Santas, especially if they're drunk:
http://www.santarchy.com/
(from the San Francisco Police Report, ""the naughty Santas ... had
reeked (sic) havoc in the emporium ... in an un-Christmas like
fashion."") * Heh. Disproving the stereotype that all accountants are boring:
some Dublin 2 company is looking for a ""Parti-time bookkeeper"" at
http://xsls.com?83 * Our attention-deficient gaze also fell briefly this week onto a box
ad in a Sunday paper which is seeking private investors for an
ADVENTURE SPORTS RETAILING business in Dublin. Now this probably
just means selling snowboards or something equally tame, but in our
imagination we see IMHO readers hunting elephants, dogfighting in
biplanes over the Wicklow Hills and abseiling down moon craters.
Just in case we're right, any ""smart, experienced partner/investor""
looking for an ""equity stake/board position"" should ""express""
""interest"" to neptune@atomic.ie. You know, it might look like we're giving these people free
advertising, but by putting their email addresses on the public web,
we're actually GUARANTEEING them spam... * * * * * * * * * IMHO'S PICK: EVENT...........................Allow Us To Demonstrate Friday is BUY NOTHING DAY. For the sake of your own mental health
and the socio-economic future, we urge you to give it a try. It's
not that hard to get through 24 hours without a purchase, and those
corporate balance sheets sure look funny with a big pre-Christmas
hole in them. The official home of BND is of course Adbusters
(http://adbusters.org/campaigns/bnd/) and they have a run-down of
Irish activities at http://xsls.com?84... rather a disappointing line-up
at this late stage, although the Zombie-Shopping in Galway sounds
like fun - shame they're moving the day to Saturday, hopefully it's
not for purpose-defeating reasons (""Friday? Damn, I'm working the
late shift at McDonald's... how about Saturday?""). In addition and
elsewhere you can expect bring-and-trade markets, flypostering, free
stuff, public speaking and all the other happy faces of democratic
consumer agitation. Punk's not dead! Party for your right to
fight! No Logo! Hare Hare! And so on. * We're now going to risk life and limb by mentioning an event which
is so diametrically opposed to the above that we might just bring
about the heat-death of the Internet by combining them in the one
newsletter. We speak of course of the benighted and spiritually-denuded sickness
of the TRILOGY FASHION SHOW in the RDS on December 4th, tickets
starting at ""just E50"" (but rising to E395 + VAT, natch). The
advertising for this bleak celebration focuses entirely on ""the most
beautiful women in the world"" who will grace the Simmonscourt
Pavilion with their airbrushed emptiness: Tyra Banks, Sophie Dahl
and Anna Kournikova (not the virus) are the only names we recognise.
You have to pore pretty closely over the small print of the press
ads to divine that it's the ""new Escada Collection"" (the who now?)
they're modelling. And in an utterly appropriate and inevitable
partnership, tickets are available from the cultural sewage
treatment system that is Ticketmaster.
http://www.cslassociates.ie/events/trilogy_fashion.htm * * * * * * * * * IMHO'S PICK: DOWNLOAD..................Transparent and Unaccountable Given our internet focus and the subversive nature of our scurrilous
publishing agenda, there is only one possible download
recommendation this week. It's the brilliant GHOSTZILLA browser, a
creation of architectural genius which brings office escapism to
heady new heights. Designed to facilitate inconspicuous worktime browsing, Ghostzilla
sits quietly and invisibly in the background until you summon it
with a special mouse movement. It then adapts itself to your
currently-uppermost application, for example Micro$oft Word, leaving
Word's toolbars intact while showing web pages in a subtle grayed-
out wash in the main window. Images appear in a subdued two-tone
unless you summon them, and the overall effect is to make it look
like you're working exactly as you should be. A casual glance from
your Office Space boss as he paces past your cubicle shouldn't
detect anything that looks like browsing. To think that someone
devoted their life to creating something so wonderfully juvenile!
It's a beautiful thing. Go ghosting at
http://www.ghostzilla.com. * * * * * * * * * IMHO'S PICK: INTERNET^HWS................................ON YER BIKE Roll up, roll up roll up! Segue right this way! Amazon is now
selling the celebrated SEGWAY (aka Ginger, aka IT) online, the hype
of the millennium finally made available to lowly consumers. You're
only four months and five thousands bucks away from participating in
the future of transport, the most fundamental and significant
breakthrough in human evolution since the invention of the leg, the
""spirit that can change the world"", etc. etc. Get out your chequebook and get your Segway at
http://makeashorterlink.com/?N49A51392. * The perfect expression of our post-modern mania for meta-media
(whoah! Easy, Chomsky!) is the utterly compelling 'Hoax Photo Test'
at http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/tests/hoaxphototest.html (If you've seen this already, that's prolly 'cos the mighty B3TA.com
featured it last Friday - credit where it's due) * ""Imagine being able to run a Google-like search on your life,"" says
one of the prophets of doom behind MyLifeBits, an incredibly Dickian
personalised self-database being developed by - who else? -
Microsoft. By cataloguing every single artifact of your life
history, storing everything in an online repository, you build a
searchable index of every conversation, document, movement, event
and action that you ever generate or perform. It's a continuous
real-time alibi recorder. It's a voluntary submission of every
second of existence to information overload. It's a system that can
show you all the photos you were ever in, tell you exactly how many
phonecalls you've ever made, or retrieve an mpeg of you going to the
toilet in March, 1986:
http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993084 Also: we knew that modern innovation was roaring ahead at a
blistering pace, but can MyLifeBits really allow ""time-shifting""?
http://research.microsoft.com/barc/MediaPresence/MyLifeBits.asp For a fictional (OR IS IT???) look at where this sinister technology
might just lead, check out this wonderful piece of short science
fiction (OR IS IT???):
http://www.ftrain.com/robot_exclusion_protocol.html
(""I'm a Googlebot! I will not kill you."") * The newest in the intriguing development of really sick-minded God-
perspective Flash games (e.g. suicide bombers at
http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/kaboom.html, giant human-burning
magnifying glass at http://xsls.com?82) has arrived... boasting a title as
bereft of imagination as the gameplay is of taste, it's 'Pedestrian
Killer':
http://www.flaboratorium.org/data/flabor/4/4.htm But if you prefer God-games which let you manipulate the very atoms
of creation, check out the awe-inspiring microscopic version of
Tetris using computer-controlled microspheres these loons have
created:
http://www.nat.vu.nl/~joost/complex/index.html. * We Irish are sometimes so uncultured, compared to our continental
cousins - even in things you'd expect us to be good at, like
vandalism. Here we get inarticulate clowns with cans of red paint
daubing ""666"" on the gates of Cardinal Connell's palatial Drumcondra
residence... whereas in Paris, to pick an example out of the blue,
egghead situationists sneakily attach absurdist plaques (e.g. ""On
April 17, 1967, nothing happened here"") onto public buildings:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2478161.stm * Microsoft have co-opted the AmIHotOrNot concept, as is their wont, mixed
it up with a bit of Miss World, and come up with the 'Microsoft Office v.
X Integrated Experience', or Ms. M.o.X.i.e. competition:
http://www.microsoft.com/mac/officex/contests/votemain.asp
Was it for this Emily Wilding Davison died beneath King George V's horse?
Was it for this that all those bras were burned? It's like Girl Power
never happened. * When good TiVos go bad: you tape one episode of Ellen, they assume
you're gay:
http://online.wsj.com/article_email/0,,SB1038261936872356908,00.html * * * * * * * * * LEGACY MEDIA.................There Was Nothing In The Air That Night IRISH TV: If you rush straight home from work after reading this on
Thursday, you might catch the second semi-final of corny but
challenging elimination quiz IT'S NOT THE ANSWER (RTE1, 17:30).
Come on the beardy guy! The final's on at the same time tomorrow.
Calm down from all that excitement with the laughable one-hour FAIR
CITY murder trial special (RTE1, 20:00) - it's quite brilliant how
the risible scripts really bring out the absolute worst in truly
terrible actors. Settle down with a few G&Ts to watch PRIME TIME on
the same channel at 21:30, where they're discussing Ireland's
alcoholic epidemic and its attendant social problems, or waste them
on either the bottom-scraping POLICE ACADEMY 3 (N2, 21:30) or the
geriatric 1978 blockbuster COMA (TG4, 22:05). Friday night, and after a hard day of buying nothing you can flop in
front of creepy Hitler doco SIX MOST EVIL MEN (N2, 21:00). Near as
we can tell, the other evil men are Macauley Culkin in UNCLE BUCK
(TV3, 20:00), gossip columnist WINCHELL in a solid eponymous biopic
(N2, 21:30), the big boss bad guy - is it Kang? Kane? Cowen? - in
MORTAL KOMBAT (TG4, 21:25), Mel Gibson in predictable 80s drug
thriller TEQUILA SUNRISE (RTE1, 23:50), and Quentin Tarantino
jumping on his own bandwagon in DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO (TV3,
0:50). Hang on, Dave Fanning might be one of the evil men too: he's
presenting THE LAST BROADCAST on Network 2 at 23:35. * * * * * * * * * COLOPHON....................................................APOLOGIA We'd like to focus mainly on the IRISH Internet, but, uh, we were

impressive, a total ""thumbs up""! Read what they're raving about and get yours at http://www.secureie.com/p/nnt1/ 01. READERS WRITE. A Wisconsin subscriber wrote to express his displeasure with the links contained in Neat Net Tricks. It seems he is bothered by the frequent pop-up ads and he felt that only those sites without the ads should be featured in NNT, particularly in the Premium issue. We replied that pop-ups can be annoying but, while not defending them, we must realize that they are a form of marketing in which the site owner hopes to recover his costs and possibly make a profit. We suggested using a pop-up stopper (there are lots of them on the Web) and ALT F4 will quickly close active pop-up windows. Finally, we pointed out that no publication can guarantee only sites without pop-up ads. As we've often said in the past, the Internet isn't free and never was. Someone has to pay the freight and if those ads are unprofitable, they will cease to exist. 02. EXTENSION SEARCH. Next time a file extension has you puzzled, try the database at http://extsearch.com/ information. 03. DUMB MESSAGES REVISITED. Not long ago we mentioned a few dumb messages we see from our computer and invited others to share their favorite ""dumbness."" A reader frequently gets a banner ad that asks ""Do you click on banner ads."" She asks, if you don't, how do you click ""No"" without clicking on the banner ad? Others galled at their computers crashing, then sitting through the Scandisk operation and being reminded ""To avoid seeing this screen again, always shut down Windows properly"" as if it was their fault. Another reader nominates the download site at http://www.microsoft.com/NTWorkstation/downloads/PowerToys/Networking/NTTweakUI.asp for having a really dumb comment. After downloading a Windows update, it says: ""How to Get Started -- You don't need to do anything after downloading"" and he asks, ""what's the point of downloading?"" Still another reader nominates the instruction manual for the Windows Internet Information Server (ILS) accessible only when ILS is operating. Thus, the entire section on troubleshooting a nonfunctional installation is inaccessible at precisely the moment one needs to consult it. But judging by the sheer quantity of email, the top dumb instruction has to be the message that ""Keyboard not detected, Press (whatever key) to Continue."" Keep them coming and we'll do it again in a future issue! 04. XP TWEAK. A recent article reminded readers of the neat things that can be done with TweakUI, but the XP operating system was not supported by the Tweak at that link. Never fear, XP folks, you'll find a whole array of power tools included Tweak - all for XP - at http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/powertoys.asp . . . . . . 1, 400+ Neat Net Tricks tips updated 4 times yearly for the word processing format of your choice, also in ebook format, plus extra features, downloadable and just $20 a year, a bargain (and a nice stocking stuffer for Santa) at http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store. . . . . . 05. HARDWARE DIAGNOSTICS TOOL. Windows98 users have a neat tool at their fingertips without downloading. Click on Start and Run and enter ""hwinfo /ui"" without quotes. The information displayed is color-coded. Error messages are in red, warnings are in blue. Green denotes registry entries, Configuration Manager information is in brown and file attributes are shown in magenta. 06. TRAINING WINDOWS. One pet peeve is Windows' determination to identify a shortcut icon as ""Shortcut to (whatever)"" This is pure redundancy, since shortcuts are identified by an arrow. And, with the added verbage of ""Short cut to"" you can't jump from one icon to another by pressing the first letter (since they would all start with an ""s"". If you keep removing ""Shortcut to,"" Windows will eventually understand your intent and future shortcuts won't include ""Shortcut to"". 07. HOLD THAT BUTTON. The site at http://www.holdthebutton.com/ invites you to hold the mouse key down. Now, before you hastily jump to conclusions that there's nothing more to this site, when you release the button, you are told how you rank in stamina with other button holders. And when I took my turn at the controls, I found that the longest record was a little over six hours, proving once again that some folks need to get a life. 08. HAGAI'S FREEWARE. A baker's dozen (13) freeware programs are at http://www.hagai.com/download.asp?ProgType=Freeware . They include a bug checker, screen saver loader, clock, shutdown utility, CD autorun, boot editor, menu, counter,icon viewer and editor, and more. 09. ONLINE HELP. Of limited scope, but considering that you can never get enough help with your computer, try http://www.computerhope.com/oh.htm . . . . . . Apologies to those readers who were inconvenienced with multiple issues of NNT Issue #137. As luck would have it, Lyris (our mail server) had hardware failure causing some of the repeated distribution. We'd like to tell you that there will never be another problem in future mailings, and if you'll buy that, as the song goes, we have some oceanfront property in Arizona for sale. . . . . . IN NEXT WEEK'S NEAT NET TRICKS PREMIUM: Google is generally accepted as the most popular search engine, but we show you another free download that enhances Google, along with a way to ""Google"" without a browser. Learn a neat trick with text manipulation, a Winamp plugin that you need if you have a taste for MP3 music, and a slick trick with your cursor.

.headline {font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial; font-size:9pt; color:000000; font-weight:bold} Hi, Check out my new site, Over 980 internal memos, updated daily. Recent highlights include: A&P: Salary, hiring freeze $Exodus: Rumors, rumors, rumors MSNBC: Sniper, parties, other news $Ebay: San Jose office moving? $EDS: Incentive & bonus changes Adobe: Workforce Realignment/Reduction $Lycos: Frank Weller resignation AOL: Past, present, and future TenFold: Reorganization Ebay: Meg addresses allegations $ Verisign: Third-party phase-out $ Ericsson: Market unstable, moving on More internal memos... Let me first welcome all the new people to the Sporadic -- there were a bunch of people who signed up a while ago but never got added until today, I think the problems have been fixed. There are currently over 250,000 subscribers to this list (dayam!). Of those, I think there are around 5 people who actually read it. So anyway, raise your hand if you're older than 30 and have never been married. Unless I meet the girl of my dreams tomorrow (which is unlikely as I don't plan on leaving my apartment tomorrow, much less wearing pants anytime in the near future), looks like I'm headed in that direction. I never think about it but it seems I'm supposed to. I definitely don't want to be one of those guys who's a bachelor for life, and I eventually want kids, I think that's cool! But today, October 30, 2002, is my 27th birthday. To celebrate, I bought myself some Rogain, tooth whitener, and a gym membership. My detergent makes the skin on my back hurt and I still have zits. Oh hey I bought a new guitar and played dress up, that was fun. It's 4:00 AM and I'm eating expired ham. Somehow I'm able to write a newsletter to 250,000 people, yet my birthday plans involve sitting home alone teaching myself Journey songs on the guitar. then Blockbuster and Chinese delivery. Woohoo! Anyway, thanks for being there. Rock on, pud ps- man, this new Sporadic layout is a little too cheery, don't you think? blah, i'll fix it later. pps- if you need web hosting or are a hosting provider, check out my new site Bizient.com Here are some of today's newest fucks. As usual, more new ones on the site daily. http://www.fuckedcompany.com/ this internal memo sent to Clifford Chance LLP employees lists a ton of ""problem areas"", complaints and comments... Highlights include, ""If the assigning system isn't corrupt, ask yourself: why aren't attractive female associates ever out of work?"" and ""Not only is he dishonest, but he behaves completely inappropriately with female associates working under him"".. and so on. When: 10/30/2002 Company: Clifford Chance LLP Points: 135 news, and of course here's the internal memo that was sent to employees. From one FC reader and pissed-off employee who worked hard for his options, ""Here's my favorite one. Q. What will happen to my Epicentric employee stock options? A. Once the purchase of Epicentric is complete, Epicentric stock options will be cancelled."" When: 10/30/2002 Company: Epicentric Points: 185 denied $1.1 million bonus for falsely claiming to have completed a masters degree. What a fuckbasket cock-socket he is. When: 10/30/2002 Company: Bausch & Lomb A&P supermarkets, here's the internal memo sent to employees. When: 10/30/2002 Company: A&P Points: 120 CDNow was set to layoff 60 people... well rumor has it the axe just fell and the *entire* programming staff was let go. Whether this means the company is shutting down or they're just being replaced by cheaper consultants remains to be seen... When: 10/30/2002 Company: CdNow Points: 169 Kestrel Solutions filed Chapter 11 today. Anyone need a sweet deal on a bit-rate independent multiplexer? uhh.. didnt think so. When: 10/30/2002 Company: Kestrel Solutions Points: 165 Xerox. Word is high-ranking managers are having assignments removed, work load reduced, etc... Sometime mid-next week is said to be d-day.
